13:<Hey, this is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I'm in Scotland but originally from Germany. First course for me as well, even if I'm at University here in Scotland aiming for a Science Degree so I really welcome this course. Greetings out to everyone. :-)>
14:<I´m from Colombia too! :)>
15:<Hello from France :)>
16:<Nice try, my editing was a bit similar:
"Figure 2 presents two electron trajectories drawn by the return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up"
but I am not really sure about the word "drawn". Please leave your critics :)>
17:<Hello from the Netherlands :)>
18:<Hello to every body,

My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I am  a physiotherapist from Colombia, I am glad to share this space with all of you, I would like to learn about scientific writing for my job and for study. I hope we can help each others and learn a lot... :D>
23:<Hello Fotini, and All, from Athens Greece!

Great to join you in this course!

24:<Hopefully through this class you'll learn how to cut other needless words so you can avoid the acronyms! :)>
25:<Hi all, 

I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Taiwan but studying in Australia. I believe this course will help me a lot with my thesis writing. :)>
26:<Reviewer and editors love good writing! If I'm reviewing a paper and I can't figure what the authors are trying to say, I'm much more likely to recommend rejecting it. I can't judge the paper if I can't understand it. On the other hand, I've never reviewed a paper where my complaint was that the language was over-simplified! ;) So, if I can get scientists to simplify somewhat I'll be happy.>
27:<Definitely stick to your own country's conventions! There may be slight differences with the way I would edit things in American English. But try to find other places to cut ;)>
28:<They mean exactly the same thing if the baby is less than 28 days old :)>
29:<Hello everyone,

I am a PhD student in Epidemiology at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Texas (USA). I have done my medical school from India and an MPH from Houston. I am really excited to meet everyone and this has been literally the biggest 'classroom' I have ever 'sat' in! :)

I look forward to learning more from each and everyone of you. 

Regards,
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
30:<I just think it is a fashion, nowadays they put an impact on writing in active voice instead of passive, which was popular and recommended some time ago - it's a way that it is, 
don't be afraid the passive will be back, the point is to catch up with the moment when it become popular again :)>
31:<Thanks! BTW: this course is great, the principles you explain are very useful (intended use of very;)).>

P.S. I find that most of the lectures already have subtitles except 1.1.>
34:<Hi Mariana,I'm somehow in your situation too,nice to meet you
:-)>
35:<Honestly, I don't like acronyms, because scientists often make acronyms from everything :)>
36:<But I am sure that it was article for specialists, not article in popular magazine, so your language depends on readers and very often no need to make science writing looking like popular. 
I believe that for professionals in this fild easier to read miR, than every time get stuck on full name. It is boring and take time. 
But we here to learn how to make Sciwrite not only for colleages who work on same problem, but also for colleages who need information, but have no so deep knoweleges as autor has :))
Hope that you understand what I mean as i took this course with hope to  write my thoughts in English clearly, may be not so good as in native language, but.... :))>
37:<I think somewhere I have read that the languague of this course is English US. Not UK. So this seems like the 'rules' for this course. Often though I find the quizzes unfair because you where obviously right in this case. But this reather stupid robot will only tolerate one solution. I got one wrong because I forget a puntuation.. Thats just the name of the game... (please be gentle to me - my english is really poor and im trying hard to formulate polite :-)>
38:<Hello community!

It's <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> here, from Italy, trying to challenge myself and hoping to achieve some good results in terms of acquired knowledge, skills and...of fun in sharing mistakes and positive experiences! I work in the field of international cooperation but I'm also interested in translation work. 
I wish everybody (including myself!) an exciting learning and sharing time. :-)>
39:<Thanks for that note. My only argument would be that this was for Cell, which is a high-impact, wide-audience journal. So, it would be helpful to write for a wider audience. I'm a scientist who was not familiar with the acronym, and I want to be included in the audience :)>
40:<There's a module on this topic in Unit 2 :)>
41:<Your techer taught you well!  And I agree, once you've edited out all but the main idea, then it becomes elegant. :)>

48:<Hi, everybody! A lot is said about Example 2, but what about Example 1? I have so many doutbts about it, and I hope nobody minds if I share (discussion is welcomed =)).

1.	I can’t get, why we shall omit “studies” in “using as examples studies that illustrate…”. It seems as if the author of the given article provided the reader with HIS/HER OWN examples. In fact, I think there is an important reference to the studies of other scholars, which are used as examples.
2.	The next thing I totally disagree is the omission of “methodological”. Why should any article dealing with study design necessarily imply methodology matters? Methodology is the system of methods and principles used in a particular sphere of science, and it is just one of many issues on the topic of cancer biology study design.
3.	The use of “successful” with “solution” really doesn’t seem to be the best solution =) The author should better have chosen either “optimal”, “reasonable” or even “noteworthy”. Still it’s obvious, that he/she meant this very thing. Solution can be qualitatively gradable: on can find a good solution (=successful solution) as well as a bad solution (=unsuccessful, wrong). The use of adjective in this case is urgent, because it renders the author’s attitude (he/she finds them great) and the author’s intention (to use them as an example to show how it must be done). To my mind, another point is the proper choice of this adjective.
4.	The headshot: “striking that whole last little bit” makes the sentence incomprehensible: I don’t understand, what specific challenges and what solutions are meant.

I’m far from the sphere of medicine and may not understand everything perfectly. And I am not setting myself up to be a well-experienced scientific writer in English as well. Errare humanum est. So, correction, objection and clearing-up are appreciated =)>

53:<Hi Kristin!
Thanks a lot for teaching SciWrite this year too. Congratulations to all of you at OpenEdX and thanks again! Please keep up the great work!

For OpenEdX team: Redeskako, Ugo, ThaoQuach and Semyon are right. We are experiencing issues while submitting reply to some very easy questions. Quiz 1.2 expected the answers in Capitalization with a period at the end. While in Homework, questions 1.2, 1.3, 1.6 and 1.7 didn't want the answers to start with capital initials or end with a period. Hence the computer marked all such answers as incorrect. So far, the auto-feedback cost me 4 points :) Please communicate it with the team for correct grading for future. And kindly adjust my score accordingly. Thank you so much.>
54:<sorry...misspelt "considering":-)>
55:<Thanks for pointing out my error! :) I'm sure you will catch some typos (spoken or written) like this. We appreciate if you bring them to our attention so we can fix them for future iterations of the course.>
56:<I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Portugal. I'm a veterinarian, and I'm really glad to take this course. It's always great to learn science writing skills, but I'm also very interested in communicating science to the lay public, which usually takes a LOT of deprogramming! So I hope this course covers that too! Great to be here :)>
57:<I wrote in the same way:) thank for the post.>
58:<Maybe it's important to cut the clutter and improve readability for the general audience. But, at the same time, it's important not to perpetuate misconceptions with the use of too vague terms, especially among the lay people who tend to get easily confused exactly because they are lay people (or even people from tangent fields). As I said in the previous section, I feel strongly that in some of the examples here as well as in the previous section, cutting the clutter resulted in over-simplification and loss of precision. The trade-off between readability and precision is not trivial and should be taken into account on a case-by-case basis. It's too simplified to just say "simplify your writing" without considering this trade-off :-) Again, I would not consider readability as the same as clarity because I think clarity should include precision.>
59:<Hi, dear colleagues! I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, first year Master student in biochemistry and molecular biology. It's my first online course, but I already like it!

72:<Hi Lea, I'm not an Instructor but I'll try to help you :) When you submit your answers in the Self-Assessment portion, it will appear one box for you to confirm your final answer (kind like the boxes of Google chrome when you enter a site that it's strange for the browser). Only after you confirm it, the model response and the self-assessment will appear. Hope I helped! :)>
73:<I think when you say "Neuro injuries", it sounds like injuries in neurons, microglia, etc. Brain and spinal cord injuries give the idea of something more physical than cellular. But it's just my oppinion! :D>
74:<Hello!! I'm a Greek doing my master in Germany ;)>
75:<Hi there :) I have a question in the 2nd example of module 2.3: "Major differences in the reaction times of the two study objects were found". I know that there actually wasn't a subject in the sentence, but can we rewrite "The two study objects had major differences in the reaction times"? To me make sense, but I'm not sure if I can rewrite that way :/>

79:<Sorry, I'm not going to give out the answers until the end of the course. This is because we will be giving students a similar post-course assessment to see what students learned. And we don't want to give away the answers before then! But you will get them at the end of the course. And you may hesitate less on some of them after taking the course. :)>
80:<hi from Poland ;)>
81:<Hellow everyone!

First of all, Kristina, thank you a lot for this great course! The material of the first two weeks alone is already proved to be very useful.

However, as I've completed all the quizes and homeworks available for now I begin to feel that I need much more technical practice and less creative tasks. What I mean is: each described technique (cut the clutter, nouns->verbs, passive->active, etc.) needs time and practice to master. And to do it efficiently you need to concentrate on each one separately and do a lot of methodical work.
I understand that nothing forbids me to take any scientific paper and use it as a self-task material, but I really whould preffer larger quizes =)>
82:<I used many instead- Many chemistry majors are creative and energetic.  That still allows for the few who are not creative or energetic ;)>
83:<I made the same error :) good to know I wasn't the only one, who missed that! By the way I just sorted the problem, it doesn't seem to work well with internet explorer, but google chrome does the trick (although it still did not show the correct answer for has not...it's a mystery!).>
84:<Hi both,

Nice to hear that we are widely distributed :) I am from Lithuania and currently starting a PhD in Cognitive Psychology. I enrolled in this course to improve my English writing as most of Psychological research is written and published in English! 
I am really enjoying the course at the moment. I hope you're having fun too :)

Good luck!>
85:<Hi everybody,

My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I from Colombia.  Now I'm a PhD student in Electronics Engineer. I hope with this course improve my writing skills, because it is very necessary :).>
86:<You are blazingly fast at editing these essays in the demonstrations - its hard to keep up!  How long does it actually take you to edit these essays when you first see them?  I think this is important to know, especially for beginning writers and editors, so that we don't get discouraged. :-)

This is a great class and I am learning so much!>
87:<*We* always found this habit a bit schizophrenic. :-) If the paper has only one author, *we* should use the first person.

Compare: "applying Theorem 3, we can find a simple proof for Lemma 5" with "applying Theorem 3, I found a proof for Lemma 5".

It's liberating!>
88:<Hi from Mexico! :)>
89:<Glad you're enjoying the class! I went through the essays before I did the demo edits, so they definitely took longer to edit than the run time in the video. :) I'd allocate at least a few hours for this type of essay, especially when you're new to editing.>
90:<Marvelous! Even Watson and Crick could have used an editor. :)>
91:<Hi everyone,

This is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> - a security engineer staying in New York. I'm looking forward to completion.

Cheers :)>
92:<Nonso, I like that you posted all of your edits!

I'm with you on #1. 

For #2 I would keep Clinical in place.

For #3 I think that p53 needs to be uncapitalized since that is a technical/biological term.

For #4 I wrote "Brain and spinal cord injuries are among the most devastating and expensive to treat." I think the author intended to compare the brain and spinal cord injuries to other bodily injuries with the words "among the most". Perhaps this should be made more explicit, like: "Of all bodily injuries, those to the brain and spinal cord are among the most devastating and expensive to treat." What do you think? I'm trying for a balance between brevity and clarity.

I rewrote #5 "An IQ test measures an individual’s verbal communication, reasoning and performance of motor and spatial tasks." For me the single word "move" loses some of the meaning of performing tasks. 

To be honest I had a difficult time editing #6. This is probably because I studied physics and I need to know more about the nature of the experiment to be able to edit the sentence while keeping its meaning intact. So I have more than one possible alternative:

 - Figure 2 shows an association between two electron trajectories and less than 3.2 Up return kinetic energy. 
 - Figure 2 shows two electron trajectories associated with less than 3.2 Up return kinetic energy.
 - Figure 2 shows that when the return kinetic energy drops below 3.2 Up, two electron trajectories appear.

I'm not really happy with any of these alternates though the last one makes me the least unhappy ;)

I would be interested in feedback & comments on these.>
93:<"Final submit" applies to individual questions. I hope this is both 'clear' and 'brief'. :)>
94:<Agreed with what you said, but I have some different opinion about the original sentence. You said that: 'if you do X, it'll be be MUCH better, then in the same breath say "but NOT MUCH better."' But in the first part the author just say that it may be argued, so it is not sure whether we have a much better results. And then in second part, 'while this is to a certain extent true', mean even we have a better one, it will not be a MUCH better one.( maybe just a small better one :) )

As for your opinion, I think the teacher's edition surely expressed the writer's main thought, but just like I said, it's more like a summary, what do you think?>
95:<The correct answer is lacks :)>
96:<Hey! 

I am from Athens too. I hold a MSc and BA in Psychology and will soon apply for a PhD in the US.

Great to join you all here :)

ps= i think a couple of other Hellenes participate in this course too.>
97:<Hello everyone, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm from Colombia. I'm studying Biology. I'm glad to be in this course :)>
98:<My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Mexico! =)>
99:<OMG. First time I answered "new", after that I answered "innovations", but correct answer was "new innovations", my God! My English is not good :(( Maybe it's because I'm from Syberia? Please give me more chance! :))>
100:<I agree! :)>
101:<Hi kristin,
I didn't expect that the first unit itself will answer my previously posted question. This session was highly informative and I learnt new things.

Thanks!

p.s. I already started to edit my lines... (had earlier written "itself will give me the answer to my previously...) ;)>
102:<hi vahidzolf:). 
I'm from Iran, too and I'm happy not to be alone here.>
103:<Hi,

I have summited the answer for the first question ("1.	Identify one of the unnecessary adverbs in the following sentence:Physicists generally write very well.") twice and it was supposed to be incorrect, but when I clicked on show the answer" it shows the word "EXPLANATION" which it doesn't even appear in the sentence. Is there any problem with the quiz?

Thank you>
104:<"Students who want to improve their essay grade can submit an optional third essay. The lowest of the three essay scores will be dropped." (from the Course Syllabus) ;)>
105:<Nice to see you self-editing already! :)>
106:<Oh, that pause-edit practice is indeed the best way to build the understanding of the logic. But to understand principles is not enough to master any practical skill. You need to grind. Your eyes, your ears and hands should also understand, and they're not nearly as smart as you =) So they need tons of boring typical tasks like the ones you see in quizes. It's like learning to dance. Before you are able to improvise, you need to learn the moves. To learn and polish.

I know, one of my problems is the language. My grasp of English is not so strong, I'm just unable to devise many of these cool reformulations that I see in lectures and homework's answers.>
107:<I mean "if you submitted your work". ;)>
108:<Thanks a lot. :D>
109:<Woow, I did the same =) I think, "to treat" is urgent here, cos an expensive injury ...hmmm :/>
110:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm a architect from Venezuela, and I'm still learning english but I really want to improve my writing because I'm a professor and researcher at the university and I hope to publish my results.
I hope to understand everything. :)>
111:<Ahaaa!! You are avoiding bias...

... I do it the same :)>
112:<I have the same problem

> Hi, I have answered and submitted the quizz 1.5 correctly and my answers have been considered mistaken.

Yes, I put the periord. Even I copy and paste. I don´t understand (automatic grading system criteria) but I learn :)>
113:<This interesting debate causes in me a power insight... Dr Kristin and partners thanks to open my eyes (and mind)!!!

1. If we keep **OPENMIND** and **FLEXIBLE** (adaptative) will be better.
I percive too much language programming, prejudge, paradigm and dogmatism (in others forum´s threads too). Just isn´t contradict to **open** and **skeptical** actitude, own of science?

2. The key point is that active and pasive voices, **CO-EXIST**. There are not exclude. We have to use both, with criteria... Unfortunately nobody (even editors) can measure it.
I think that principal problem is OVERusing that using either.

3. In other hand, if editors by principal currents medicine journals (Science, Nature, PLoS, BJM , AMA, etc) and many styles recomendations, promotes active voice; you only have to follow or write a (disgust) letter to editorial commite :) Remember publish or perish...

4. KISS (keep it short and simple) is brilliant guide. If active voice don´t loose precision and rigorous; what´s the problem? isn´t seem "academic"?, isn´t seem crytic and complicate? People speak in pasive voice in all cultures, isn´t. Natural speak is in active voice and it´s simple and understandable. 

5. What´s it say neurolinguistics (evidence) about? What´s say Chomsky about? What´s say the EVIDENCE?

6. For many years I feel ridiculous overuse of pasive voice in sciwrite but was the "rules" or style (old fashion?). I think that is analogous to slang of rappers, militaries... Need the sciencist built own jerom, or scientist only have to use technical terms when/where it´s necesary puting at key point his audience...?  

Happy weekend and enjoy it the course!!!

Best regards for all

JP, from Chile>
114:<I did a similar clause reversal 
"Figure 2 illustrates that two electron trajectories are associated with return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up."

I like yours better though. :)>
115:<I have the question about "cutting" the last example in module 1.6. Can I cut it like this:
"Fig.2 shows the possibility of two electron trajectories if a return kinetic energy is less than 3,2 Up."

120:<Hello everybody! The course is being even more exciting than expected! Regards from Spain! ;)>
121:<It depends on whether or not the distinction between neonates and newborns matters for the context. When I edited it originally, I left it as neonates. But then I realized that newborns might be a more reader-friendly term and was sufficiently precise for this context. But my pediatrician and neonatologist friends insist on neonate every time ;)>
122:<I'm sure there are regional differences in the use of discuss and argue. To me, they both have equal value. The argument can be made that both argue and discuss are correct. :)>
123:<Hi, nice to meet you! The same situation to me, the majority of scientific biological articles are written in English, so it's necessary to improve English writing skills :) It will help even to read better! Good luck with your PhD! I'm sure your field of knowledge is really interesting and powerful!>
124:<Hi, Carlos! Nice to meet you! :) I am a first year Master student in Biochemistry and Molecular biology. My great desire is to improve English writing and reading skills as well as to communicate with new people from all over the world :)>
125:<Hi! Nice to meet you! :) I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Ukraine and now I'm a first year Master student in Biochemistry and Molecular biology. Good luck with your PhD!>
126:<Just feel the same and agree with you. I am the medical translator from English. Some people have talent to write so complicated and so boring...Most scientists **HAVE to** take this course to learn simple clear writing, haven't they?
I am very good in my native language writing and editing and from this course I understood that writing rules are almost the same for all languages.  Writing should be easy, clear, interesting. Hope this course would  help me to write better in English :)))>
127:<I'm hoping to get you to break a few of these "writing rules" that you've been taught before :)>
128:<When you're working directly with authors, you can have some back and forth. Some researchers may insist on the more technical term, whereas others will not even notice that I changed it to fitness. :)>
129:<Thank you for the responses. Yes ttttamaki, I agree with you in that we have 2 type of writing. one to impress people with the beauty of it, and other to be easy enough to find the main idea easily and quickly without much effort! (maybe this was the first lesson of unit one!)  :))

yes Vira, It seems that beside the writing tips we should learn also a way of simple and straight thinking for transferring our scientific ideas!>
130:<I have many redundancies in speaking that I cringe at in writing! When I see the closed captions of my speech, I immediately want to get out the red pen. :) I have not yet successfully trained myself to self-edit while speaking; I have to see the words written down before it registers with my brain!  But it's something I'm working on now that all my spoken work is being closed captioned. :)>
131:<My Name is Bud <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, and I live just south (and slightly left) of Nashville Tennessee in the USA. 

I am very pleased to be attempting my first OpenEdX course, and do look very much forward to learning, growing and sharing with everyone in this small, and intimate (??) learning environment. 

I know that my success is in here, somewhere. Now I'm going to go find it! :) Much good luck on YOUR journey. If I can help, please let me know. I'll do what I can. Who knows, I might be asking for your help...soon!>
132:<It is a funny thing as single author. There are all different characters in science but I think it is the polite way to go with "we". You might have been inspired by your colleagues and professors and they might have helped to set up everything around your actual experiment (material, study design, revising the manuscript etc). And even if you did it all by yourself then your name will be listed as first author which transmits the information that you most likely did all the big parts. And because there are only so few cases where one really did everything I think it is generally advised to write "we" to not sound too posh. But this is just my "humble" opinion ;) 
Congrats on your paper submission!>
133:<Hi I'm students from China. :) For I'm always required to write long papers, I love to use kinds of wordy expression in writing and my writing started to become worse and worse. It's really nice that cutting clutters makes writing easy-understanding. But I think this should be a main principle, sometimes negative expression or wordy phrases are necessary according to different conditions, especially when you have to point out something. Positive speaking helps author express his/her ideas obviously, but too many same expressions would lead to monotony.>
134:<I have yet to encounter a reviewer or editor who rejected a paper because the language was too simple. But I know lots of examples where they rejected a paper because the language was incomprehensible. :) So I hope to convince you that you will increase your chances of acceptance by employing simple language.>
135:<In real life articles you'll have to understand the context, too. Many things you can cut out, because they are clear from the context.

I'm a German native speaker and I can tell you that the German language is full of clutter. Writing in English is actually easier, because you can be a little bit more sloppy with the words. In German you say "Strassenbahnhaltestelle", which means "the location where the street train stops". This is of course much more to the point as "tram stop", but it is annoyingly and unnecessarily precise :-)>
136:<I think the point is, that in this particular sentence the insertion of "muscular and cardio-respiratory performance" makes the sentence harder to read. It depends on the context if it's replacement by "fitness" is to vague, but if it is, then you could add another sentence to make it clear.
As it has been said: writing is not easy :-)>
137:<That is exactly why scientific articles are often that difficult to read: 
the authors just want to be exact and try to accomplish that by using more words. What I've learned in this course is, that you don't always need to be exact, it is more important to be clear: have a clear idea what you want to say and find words that allow the reader to understand your idea. And is you succeed, then your article is readable for the experts and the lay people.
After publishing more than 40 articles, I finally see what I can improve :-)>
138:<Hi, there! I'm a graduate student in Taiwan, majored in linguistics. I'll be writing a neurolinguistic paper for my thesis. I have a feeling that I'll gain a lot with this on-line course. By the way, it's my FIRST on-line course. :-)   
I'm happy to edit papers in the field of neurolinguistics or cognitive neuroscience. Feel free to send me the papers if you need my editing. ;-)
Nice to meet you all!>

144:<In my opinion, English we often learn in high school is little bit different from the one using in academic writing. Frankly speaking, use of concise and brevity phrases is really necessary in scientific papers. We are not writers. :)>

148:<Hello all,

I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, 24 years old, third-year PhD student in France but I'm from Mauritius. I'm PhDing in meteorology: tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean. 

Writing scientific articles for the thesis is so painful and this course is really helping me! The first week was so interesting, I can see all that clutter in my sentences! I'm less thrilled by the 2nd week course because I'm not so interested in spending time on converting passive in active voice, which is really simple in my opinion. But at least, I learnt that "I" and "We" were OK! :) Looking forward to the 3rd week!>
149:<Hi, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Russia. Ten or more years ago, after graduation, I worked as a scientist in the field of laser isotope separation (AVLIS), but in recent years I've been a techwriter, and now my scope of activity is software for nuclear power plants. 

Though I understand almost nothing in medicine and biology :), it is nonetheless quite a useful course for me, because my professional activity is closely related to writing, editing, and translating.

During the course I'm going not only to improve my writing skills in English but also to see how this teaching method and some of the principles we are being taught here could be — sorry for the passive voice :), I can't do without it — applied for the same purpose to my native language.>
150:<I thought exactly the same.
Luckily I understand that your friend does acknowledge the existence of academic careers that  are not sustained by an engineering degree;)>
151:<Dear Christine, thanks for everything. I just watched the first video and am really excited about the course.
Just a short feedback concerning the videos. If you have thousands of students watching, it may be worth having a lavallier microphone to avoid that your voice sounds like it is coming from a tin can (I am exaggerating) and maybe move to a nicer room with an attractive background.
Of course, this is just about the way it looks, it isn't too important. But it's maybe a bit more important than wearing this nice blue suit :)
have a nice day,

152:<Greetings,

I have to write down this post just to thank you for this course. Up to point 1.3 I am not only enjoying it, but also using it to rethink and rewrite my current dissertation. 

Also, as English is my second lengauge, I congratulate the speaker (who I canot remember the name right now, sorry) for introducing the subjects in such a clear and calm way. It is deligthfull to hear you talking! :)

One more time, thanks for this course,

153:<**but still received *an* "incorrect". :)>
154:<As a Spanish speaker myself, I concur :)

Related to that, I migh add Spanish speakers tend to write long sentences in English because that's one of the characteristics in Spanish: why would you say "ice-cream shop" when you could say "the shop of ice-creams" instead? LOL>

172:<These are my edits; I have tried to apply the clutter-cutting, apart from turning the sentences into active voice.

 - The DSMB committee recommended to halt the study.
   
 - We found major differences in the two subjects' reaction times. 
   
 - The editors concluded that the authors had falsified the data. [I
   tried to keep the verbal tense in the second part, but as far as I
   can see, simple past and past perfect are fairly exchangeable in
   english...]
   
 - NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has photographed the first
   visible-light of a planet circling another star.
EDIT: I realised that was awfully wrong heheh. Let's try again:
NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star. [No way to cut some clutter out!!] :)
   
 - Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that a double transtibial
   amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter perform at the same
   kinetic level.>
173:<Dear Dr Sainani

I want to thank you for the wonderful course and i'm sure by the end of it, i will write better. I can already see a lot of clutter in my writing. :)
However, i see a discrepancy in the assessment of my quiz(1.5 b ) where you have specified that spellings and correct punctuation are required. I feel it's unfair to lose a mark for not starting the sentence with a capital letter while a punctuation mark (full stop) is being ignored by the system.>

176:<Hey! Thanks for your comments, but meant something else. I find sometimes too specific to cut a sentence so much, because the meaning is already understandable and also enjoyable to me. But it might be only me :)>
177:<My feeling is that expressing it like that would be OK, if the significance level was also stated, i.e. 90% of clinical seizures...

186:<Mine was “We chose sample sizes for all animal groups so that it would clearly demonstrate the effects of behavioral tests.”. 

After seeing the model answer, however, I now think that by rephrasing the final part into something like “effectively observe the effects” or “clearly demonstrate the effects” we are losing some meaning from the original.

The word “signal” seems to refer to a specific term that is used in the field of the article. See for instance these articles that explain what a stop signal task is: [1][1], [2][2], [3][3].

I’d also be glad to hear some additional opinions about this.

188:<When you're writing the manuscript about your scientific research, you are the authority! :)>
189:<lavmagno, the title of the course is Writing in the Sciences, not Writing in Medicine.

On the other hand, the examples are OK so far. Also it is easy to understand that Kristen is sharing examples from her own experience. Besides, she recommended showing our drafts to lay persons to help us writing clearly. So no problem.

Maybe in future editions of the course some examples from other sciences can be provided --a proper use of the passive voice, right? :)  Maybe some of the students here would submit some.

Good learning>
190:<And me too:-) (<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>)>

194:<You will get faster at this with more practice :)>
195:<"lear scarce" is NOT the same as "would not learn" ... it is close, but not the same IMHO ... :)>
196:<Ok ... I don't like "Shifting" for some reason ;) but I think Prof. Sainani had the text to base her edit. 

Without the context I got: 

"Changing proportions are not the result of increases in moderate and severe injuries, but the **absence** of mildly injured persons at the hospital.">
197:<Isn't the use of a extra "in the disorder's" a repetition? 
Could it not just plainly be substituted for "its" ? 

And "have begun to describe" to "are now describing" ? 
3 words instead of 4  ...  ;) 

So my edit would be: "Studies are now describing the epidemiology of autism, including recent changes in its prevalence and characteristics.">

201:<I would like to agree that the original sentence contains too much of tech jargons in it. It took me to rewire my brain and scribble my response many times before i understood what i wrote.

204:<Thank you! :)

205:<Please share your response! :)>
206:<Can't remember exactly what they said...but I think they would fail this course:-) My real (serious) question is whether there is any room for mixing poetry/artistic-flair with writing in the sciences?>
207:<Aloha all - <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from USA - I am taking this course to improve my writing  by reducing clutter and cleaner sentences. I am not a medical student so the editing that changes technical terms into more common terms is a little difficult. Is there a reference for this out there? My background is more general biology.  
Thanks :)>
208:<Yes, that should be "fewer"!  The passive voice occasionally makes more sense even in conversation. It does exist in the English language for a reason. So, I think most people may use it occasionally. It would be very odd if all your spoken sentences were in the passive voice, however.  :)>
209:<I love the course, but I think some of the sentences are too technical (e.g. Unit 2 Homework Question 2.6 -> what is a "raised nevi"(it is not in Cambridge online dictionary)? should I search on Google the meaning of words?). 

This is very annoying in homework exercises, because I am not able to correctly understand the meaning of the sentences in order to rephrase them. I have a computer science background and I am not a native English speaker. It would be great to know if others are having the same problem and if so solving it could be a big plus, especially for an online course. 

Thank you :-)>
210:<I think the appropriate use passive voice is where the subject is more important than the subject. :-)>

Though I kept in mind and tried to use the rule on "increasing level of separation"  (comcoldapsep, just a mnemonic I made up for the purpose of answering this particular quiz :-)), my 2 attempts to answer the first question were marked wrong. So, yes, the context (or intention of the writer) is important to be able to arrive at the correct answer.>

217:<Dear Dr. Sainani,

First of all, I would like to congratulate you on creating the best online course ever! It's a real pleasure to participate in it. 
I have a problem conntected with using formal and informal language in essays, particularly abbreviations. I understand that regardless of the fact that sometimes they are used in the exemplary sentences, they should not occur in essays, should they? I am not a native speaker (I am a Pole), therefore I would just like to make sure what are the rules of American English (I was taught mostly British English). When it comes to scientific writing, abbreviations should not be used. How about essays? Greetings from Poland:)

Sophie>
218:<Agree... A lot depends on the context as jenscu mentioned. So each one is right in their own way :-)>
219:<Oops, I meant "my first choice was correct". Trying to get the negatives out of my head, but they won't go :D>
220:<I assume that as Unit 2 is still active until the homework is submitted this noon, they might display the answers after then, possibly to avoid copying :p..>
221:<This video is very information. Thank you Professor. But I have a few doubts as well. When can we use "talk to" and "talk with"? And when to use the words each and every, like for example "each student" and "every student"?. If only we could know in which context to use which word, writing would not have been this complicated, well atleast to me :)..>
222:<you can always take a break :)
I watch it on my commute and take breaks when my concentration fades.>
223:<I think, analyzing the structure of the sentence may help you.

Why did they use the passive voice? Obviously, to make the main thing they're talking about the grammatical subject and to put it in the beginning of the sentence. Thus, you shouldn't at least miss what the author decided to make the most important. 

In the original, the main thing is the validity that they evaluated by means of comparing. You say only about the fact of comparing, without mentioning its purpose. While this very purpose (to evaluate the validity) is nothing else but a rephrased version of that very main thing of the original. :)>
224:<Yes, I think this is the one where I have a long story about the Red Sox. If you're not a Red Sox fan, sorry! ;)>
225:<I really enjoyed the Red Sox story! Though, I know almost nothing about baseball.

I guess NOW-not even the next minute-is a good time for me to google some baseball knowledge.

See, I even used a dash! :-)>
226:<Hello from Athens,

In the recent years, 'man' is not "politically correct", as it excludes women. So the word to use is 'human' instead. (You may find more words that one should not use anymore "writing in sciences"--words that discriminate human groups for example). And, yes, 'mam' derives from 'human'.

Hope it helps

:) -T>
227:<Good one :-)>
228:<So welcome!

:) -T>
229:<Hello Eliah,

According to the APA (American Psychologists Association) style, 6th Ed., one should not link words with hyphens: one should write them separately (with few exceptions). So, I try to avoid it. 

As for dashes: double ones, just before (that is, no space) the word.

APA style is common for psychology, and for humanistic, social and behavioral sciences (and a couple of others, which i do not recall right now). For more, you might want to check this link: http://www.apastyle.org/

Hope it helps,

Best,

:) -T>
230:<Hello CatherineLeona,

You use the DOI depending on the science you prepare your References, and/or the requirements of the Journal, or the Professor, or the magazine, and so on.

For psychology one uses mostly the APA style, here =http://www.apastyle.org/search.aspx?query=&fq=StyleTopicFilt:%22References%22%20AND%20StyleChapterFilt:%227.%20Reference%20Examples%22&sort=ContentDateSort%20desc

where you will find examples of citations for papers, books, thesis, and so on.
Except for the APA style, which is identical with the Harvard style, more styles are in use, as: the Vancouver style, the MLA, and the Chicago manual --just to mention a few.

Hope it helps

Best from Athens,

:) -Tia>
231:<yeah, that didn't help :-) (Could you delete this answer, please?)>
232:<Thanks for the tip EEliott!!

:) -T>
233:<Up to the point, I guess... It is also our decision if we agree with the peer or not... Still, an answer from Dr. Sainani would be helpful:)>
234:<Hi Pedro,

Yes, if one uses someone else's words or ideas, plagiarism occurs; even the use of few words that somebody else wrote consist of plagiarism.  In such case one should use brackets +citation (and if possible page too, if from a book; not if from a paper). 

Most Universities have extremely severe policies in such acts. So, one should be really cautious to cite, not just acknowledge his or her sources (even inaccuracies in the References are considered as plagiarism). 

Hope it helps

:) -Tia>
235:<Just keep in mind that your science will not be simple even if your language is. I hope to convince you that reviewers and editors want clear, simple writing! I have yet to see a reviewer or editor comment that a paper is written too simply, yet I have seen many examples where a reviewer or editor commented that the paper was written too obscurely! :)>
236:<Glad I've piqued your interest in baseball! And nice use of the dash. :)>
237:<That's OK! Just do your best to guess at the original intent. I'm not providing the context for these just to keep the exercise manageable :)>
238:<I think your sentence brings about all relevant facts! :-) However, the parentheses may not be good for the information as it could be relevant for the reader and cannot be "skipped".

I'm glad to see a completely new approach to the sentence than what have been suggested this far. It helps a lot!>
239:<It's good! :-) In my opinion, I think a few punctuation marks needs to be added, to give it some breaks. "Indicents after that" could maybe be changed for "following incidents"? It may just be a matter of taste what one finds flows better.

Thanks for sharing it!>
240:<Welcome! I hope you'll get much out of this. It's been a fun course so far, in my opinion. :)>
241:<Good catch! Brigman's team should not have intracellular features ;)>
242:<Hello Tia,

Thank you for the helpful information.  APA has been nice and clear about how to cite DOI in its most recent style guide.  However, I do not see DOI being addressed in the Author Guidelines of many academic journals who often use an in-house style for References (often a slight modification of one of the major editorial style guides). For example, I am working on an interdisciplinary paper (organizational management and psychology) and the publication does not use the major editorial style guides but instead an in-house style guide. There is no mention of DOI. Of course, I could defer to the Reference section of their past articles but I do see inconsistencies.  

I am wondering how editors address this issue. It would be nice to have a definitive rule of thumb to follow, if one exists. The answer may be: ask the publication editor :)>
243:<Hello everyone, I was just looking at my progress statistics and below the graphic, where all the components of the course are mentioned I saw that the due dates of the assignments for Units 1 and 2  are now October 15th, does anyone knows what that means? Do we have more time to submit them if we didn't make it? Thank you all! :)  -<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>->

247:<Hello, I am Vidya from USA. Greetings to everyone.
First of all, I must admit that English is not my first language. I have been making good attempts to improve my speech and writing skills in English - and I know the more I practice, the better it gets.

I must say that I am really enjoying this course thus far. I am currently doing the Unit 3 and I have really found the course to be very useful to me. I cannot believe that I look at the homework statements and try to crack them during the free-time I get during working hours :-)

Although I may not write a Science thesis or publication (atleast in near future) - but the skills learnt in this course will have many applications in my work. Who knows - someday I may find myself writing a Science article :-)

Thanks Prof. Kristin and Standford Univ for providing this course. It definitely has a far-reaching effect.>
248:<That sounds great! :D

Thank you so much for this new chance.>
249:<:)>
250:<Hi Vidya,

Nice to meet you. :)

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
251:<About 400 of us have posted an intro in about three strings, so far. :-)>
252:<I am 54 and proud of it :-)

Any other one-upmanshippers or auctioneers around?>
253:<I think that videos are very long too! :-)>
254:<I agree - if I got that assignment for grading I would not have any way to tell how hot it is. I don't think it matters for the grade :)>
255:<Thanks for the info. :-)>
256:<mine starts with "over the past 1000 years..." :)

I would let go of "the fact that" - classic filler. I would also ruthlessly shorten the second sentence...>
257:<And I bet it's not just medical professionals that do this! ;)>
258:<the rule is outlined in one of the lectures: *that* is used to introduce essential information without which the sentence would not be complete. normally you'd use commas, but you could use dashes for emphasis. I hope I got this right :)>
259:<I have used this on occasion to convince fellow non-native speakers that I was right :-)>
260:<So welcome!

:) -T>
261:<This one is going to be my favourite :)>
262:<OK. Thank you:)>
263:<If I am correct, you are saying that I can use already published article/paper for restructuring. I should provide the reference link to the original article. That works for me.
As long as I don't have to scratch my head to come up with non-existing topic within the given timeline - I am glad :-)>
264:<Well that depends on the word limit :)
I wanted to write a bit to explain the context of the classic paper I'm summarizing, and thought I'd keep to best practice and include a couple of citations to back it up. But citations are not compulsory for this essay - that question was answered by staff in another thread.>
265:<forgive the late start. I am new to class today, but want to share on why I think this thread of discussion is very important.  I am a self taught student with an employment history in administration. 

So I am a layman first in the sciences. I changed careers 5 years ago, and now work in both the natural and social sciences. I work with community fishermen both for a policy agency and as a local community organizer.  Misunderstandings in my work have disastrous consequences. Misinterpreting, or misrepresenting what I'm told on the water in a policy group is a misappropriation of some other's words. (forgive the -mis, -mis here.)

Biologists, chemical oceanographers etc. have a quantitative data oriented way of looking at the world. Dialoging between fishermen and scientists is difficult.  Trust is at stake when misunderstandings take place.

p.s. I hate writing verbs as clunky nouns...it feels like frozen action:)>
266:<Think that might be the reason :) "Peer-reviewing other students’ essays will only be available after you have submitted your essay".>
267:<As is "kinda" - our Professor is just using quite informal language in her presentations. Please don't change :)>
268:<yes :)>
269:<@EElliott: yes, hopefully, they'll sort it out soon enough.

@Micahela: the same thought about quality also crossed my mind ;)>
270:<I think we're all discovering the limitations of the editing system (I guess it has to be fairly basic on this format) so am sure that no-one will take offense :)>
271:<In your second example 'in addition' and 'also' mean the same thing making the 'also' repetition. 
Your final one is very similar to what I had :)>
272:<I hope so. I guess something should be done about irresponsible grading. The second peer wrote no comments at all, just gave average marks. :)>
273:<I am a non-native soeaker, either:)>
274:<I agree with you. 
Thank you again for another great course! :)>
275:<I agree, should be no problem.
In most cases the grader would not even have access to the original paper as you usually have to have a subscription. You should summarize it the best you can to make it a good, interesting read for the grader. Go for it and write the best you can :)>
276:<I had good results with my first submission. Second submission is flagged despite clear citations where appropriate !!!. Stay safe, don't try this :).>
277:<Oh...I see. Well, I think that in this case nothing can change =) But he gave three 0 points and other two - 2 and 3 points,respectively.>
278:<I also have some miR experience and confirm it. It is generally used terminology. And it is great that it is so concise and has it own rules ("A uniform system for microRNA annotation" by Ambros et al, RNA 2003). Imagine another dozens of names like 'sonic hedgehog' that we have avoided :)>
279:<thanks for the help elliott :)>
280:<Hey,

I'm not able to open a peer's file. I need to finish writing assignment until this Friday because I'll be out of Internet until 4th of November. Can you help me to reach this file?

Thanks :)>
281:<The problem is not with searching, as I said I am a computer science engineer and searching things on Google is part of my daily work. The problem, I see, is that the purpose of the course is writing better, not learning new terminology. So the question is not about asking permission (I already searched the term and understood the meaning), is about showing an action that, I think, shouldn't be part of the course very often. The comments above show that there is place for improvement and I already sow improvements from the authors of the course in the latest materials. Thank you for that :-)>
282:<Yes 

:) -Tia>
283:<Hello!

I think it depends on the field you write for. As "typos" is the basis to understand so many deriving words (i.e. typology/ical, type/typing, typography, typophobia, typotheque, typometry, typomania, just to mention some), it is not colloquial, it is basic. To lose important words over simplicity--to me--it results in simplifying our though-process-potential. 
In two words, under my subjective lens, anyone would understand.

p.s. I am Greek :)>
284:<Hi
I see manuscripts which I should be peer reviewing and am comfortable with the grading system. I can however not work out how to annotate the manuscripts i.e. I see the information: This is an insertion.  This is a deletion.  [This is a comment.], but dont know how to actually do this in the manuscript. Do I cut the document out, pate into word, edit and paste it back for submission. maybe I'm missing something:)

293:<To read this as I do, to keep the ideas separate,  for each pair of opposites, read the first in a low voice and the one in brackets in a high squeaky one.  You will soon think you have hiccups.

"When solar activity is stronger (weaker), changes in the positive (negative) NAO/AO-like atmospheric circulation are induced (Shindell et al., 2001; Lean and Rind, 2008). Therefore, it can be expected that stronger (weaker) solar activity induces warming (cooling) in NH temperature, and relative cooling (warming) in Greenland through positive (negative) NAO. Consistent with this theory, Greenland temperatures have deviated negatively (positively) from the NH temperature trend when solar activity was stronger (weaker) over the past 800 yr (Kobashi et al., 2013). Climate modelling also indicates that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) reduces (increases) during weaker (stronger) solar activity (Cubasch et al., 1997; Waple et al., 2002), contributing to negative Greenland temperature responses to solar variability (Kobashi et al., 2013)."

If only this were the only part of this article like this.  It feels mean to provide the citation :)  But I will anyhow.

294:<You need to use those tiny little arrows to navigate to the other scores. :)>
295:<Thank you Sudarshan for taking the time to say something positive :) Its a shame the discussion board is full of complaints at the moment. The reviews I got were not very helpful but I think it's amazing that we can practice peer reviewing like this, and I'm sure that most people will gain some useful insight from the process, even if they're not happy with their grade or the comments they receive.>
296:<Interesting discussion! :-)

Here is a definition of "peer":

> a person who is equal to another in abilities, qualifications, age,
> background, and social status. (reference: reference.com)

Where there is honest scientific temper, peer review of one expert's work is done by other experts in the field, not "generic" scientists or lay persons.

Here, the "peers" are fellow coursemates who might have not much knowledge of the field we choose to write about. The way I see it, SciWrite seeks to develop the ability to communicate science to the lay person.

I learnt it the hard way, too. The first version of my essay was filled with jargon from the field, and was consistently scored as "cluttered". After removing all the jargon, the revised submission was consistently rated as "clear". Looking back, it does read a lot better. For a different peer (someone with interest in Neuroscience), the first version might make better sense.

The lesson: as stated in Prof. Sainani's instructions, write for the peers here, assuming they have zero familiarity with the topic of the essays.>
297:<Aaaah, right! Thanks a lot! :)>
298:<Yea statistics :)>
299:<Essay 2 is writing assignment 2 and it has not yet begun..I've read in another post that Dr Sainani would be posting it in the first week of November.So don't worry :)>
300:<JMP1--I cannot fix it, I am a student in the class. I do hope the admin team or OpenEdX staff can fix it soon. Not sure what else to at this point except to continue to post about it. I should write an essay on this issue for Assignment 2 :-).>
301:<Hi

I really don't believe that that's the way it's working. You'll get 13 points because 13 is the middle (not the second!) grade. The order of the grades does not matter :)

Regards
Matt>
302:<I dont have information, but from one peer I received two nuls in first and second sections and in others sections  '3" and "2". I think that nuls were clicked by mistake, but influenced total score:)) I write it to put attention atht it would br better double check before submitting>
303:<Hello,

I just read the grades for my essay and Grader 2 assigned a score of 3 for Organization (and left a comment [As for me it is a good job:))] at the end of my essay) but the other 4 scores are set to zero - I believe there has been a technical problem since my essay is not blank!
Would it be possible to do something about it? (maybe send it back for grading?)

Many thanks,
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
304:<Hi Raleen,

If I am not wrong in my understanding, they gave an example like this: 10 ,2 and 12 with score of 2 as a final. I tried to find that thread but could not. Let's hope it will be the way you said. :)

Regards,>
305:<Hi guys, both of you :)
Where do you actually read that you reviewed "one"? I couldn't even found the counter :) Could you please help me where this info can be found and I'll tell you what I see in my account. Or you just assume it shows one?>
306:<Hi there! I've just started too. How is it going for you guys? I'm guessing that prev. homeworks are just for fun, and no chance for any tips? :)

good luck for everyone !>
307:<Let me guess, you got a lower score on the second try? :)>
308:<No problem, Raj. Can see that you guys have your hands way more than full. :)

Appreciate your patience here.

309:<For the same essay I got 6, 10 and 15 points :D. Where is the fairness and objectiveness of grading then? ;)>
310:<And I've got 3, 10 and 13! =)
Should I rate ZERO someone next time?>
311:<thanks..:)problem over..>
312:<Thanx @ Meagan ..:)>
313:<Hi Sonti, thanks :)>
314:<I'm a victim of peer grading vandalism and I have every right to nag too! That is exactly what I'm going to do here. :D Horrible grading and downright stupid! I believe the grading should be restricted to the styles that we have learnt in this course and not on the content. If someone is unable to grasp the technical nitty gritty of a subject, (even though it has been converted into a pulp for easy digestion), they should refrain from making a comment. Our job is to critique the organization and style of writing, not tease with the essence of the essay. I don't think re-submission is going to help because I'll again get stupid comments!
One grader couldn't even construct his/her comment in a grammatically correct way. How could I trust that- their English comprehension is good enough and they are capable of judging my work. One grader just wrote one sentence- 'This is not a Conclusion'- and gave me an overall 6. Duh!!!! I think this Course should be converted into a Self Study Course without any Statement of Accomplishment at the end. Some people don't want to learn, they just want a Certificate! Time for some 'weed' control!>
315:<Hi All, sorry for stupid question, 

I've reviewed already more than 4 essays for the peer grading. However I get more and more of them load. Does it ever stop? :)

Thanks, 

Alex>
316:<Hi there, 
I was just wondering if homework # exists at all. In the Calendar, you find an antry, but in the respective section there is no homework - same for unit 6-8. 

Please de-confuse me here :-)
Much appreciated, 
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
317:<Hi Alex,

I think you can grade as many essays as you want, though I'm not sure; there may be a limit. So, yes, it does stop when you stop :).>
318:<Thank you Cristina :)>
319:<Hi there, 

my essay was flagged unfortunately - probably because I missed to provide the exact source at the end (and wrote it too well :-P). 
Anyway, I was wondering if someone who has experience could just quickly let me know how long it will take untill I can resubmit. It is really a pity that this happens so shortly before the deadline ...

Cheers! 
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
320:<Hi Marta!

Great idea! :)

I'm specialising on Software engineering, formal methods and human factors, but also like to write non-scientific texts (essays and fiction).>
321:<+1 :)

I have got 3 reviews.
The first review was just empty in all senses: no comments, 0 points, just blank useless response that someone has pushed a button "submit".
The second was really useful (Thank you, Anonymos! :))
The third comment one was just "The main problem with this essay is that the paragraphs are in the wrong order. If you begin with the third paragraph [...] the whole piece will be easier for the reader to navigate." (strongly disagree!) and unreasonably low scores in all rubrics. 

Imho, it's typical for online feedback, and the only way to deal with it as an author is just ignore useless stuff and everything you strongly disagree. 
... I see the result "1 of 3 reviews is useful" as a good one.>
322:<Thank you so much :)>
323:<I had an essay that was actually quite good, but used an example for word ambiguity that only works in Dutch. Happily that is my native language, but I wonder what a non-Dutch speaker would have made of this essay... It made me wonder if the essay distributing algorithm distributes explicitly to people with the same native language? There are not so many Dutch speakers around ;)>
324:<It's really nice to hear from you!

I've created a Facebook group for easier communication.
You're welcome to join it :)

https://www.facebook.com/groups/<phoneRedac><zipRedac>9669/?ref=nf

If you have some different ideas how to get in touch, just write it down here.>
325:<Dear staff of SciWrite,

The third grader give my assignment postive comments:
"(I am missing a conclusion or a last personal statement of some kind, somehow it ends a little quickly~otherwise really well written and for such a specific subject very understandable :) i liked it! )
"

However, for the grading, he/she rated my assignment two "0" points!

There must be something wrong here.>
326:<When someone gives you a 0, they have probably forgotten to grade you at all. For example, if you give grades and then edit a paper, sometimes the grades reset, so you need to watch your grades again. It happened to me, maybe it is only a minor bug but again you should double check. And about your grades: 0,5,12, it is funny because you should get 5. It is probably a mistake, but this one helped you :)>
327:<The advice is simply from various posts on here but the staff have indicated that if the second submission is scored lower then that is what will stand. Look on the bright side-at least you didn't end up with three zeroes :)>
328:<I wondered about this too, but the person giving me 0 also did not submit any edits. I also thought I would get a 5 now (and unfairly, since 0 is not true as I definitely submitted an essay and it is not plagiarized ;) ) so I was very surprised with the 12.

Still no explanation though...>
329:<Ok. Thank you so much:)>
330:<I only wrote and submitted mine yesterday, and have already received feedback and resubmitted. I had a couple of helpful reviewers who made editing suggestions, and a few who I thought graded fairly but didn't give me any specific feedback. I don't think the large chunk of people posting complaints realise that this is practice for us all to review and edit work as well as submit our own, and seem to have somewhat unrealistic ideologies about who is grading their work - we're all here to learn after all :) Good luck with your submission!>
331:<Hi Kristen and Staff,

I am already anticipating the confusion and discussions this second assignment will create :-)!  I assume that you would like each essay to stand on its own.  So, for introductions that are edited from an original - do not include the original essay, only your own edited version.  Please clarify this for students.

Thank you,
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
332:<Second assignment JUST got opened. Topics are GREAT :)>
333:<I'm concurrently taking Jeff Leak's Data Analysis and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning classes. As such, I would enjoy access to the (anonymous) peer grading data for the purposes of designing a more intelligent grading system. Just a thought. :-)>
334:<Makes sense! Thanks, Raj ! :)>
335:<the last sentence made me smile, Buc :) I can not find where I can agree to the grade and make a final submission. Can you help me, please?>
336:<You can go on and learn in the process :)>
337:<Hi. I am interested too. My field is geographical information systems and geomatics. Especially with environmental apliations (such as forest fires and landscape studies). But I would read essays and fiction as well :)>
338:<Thanks for asking-- I was just wondering about that myself-- it seems to make sense to post the original text so that the 'markers' can follow our 'improvements'. :) there were quite a few comments on the last assignment from people who thought that the original texts submitted were better than the corrected versions!>
339:<Hi there,

I've submitted my essay, and I've reviewed and edited 4 essays from my peers. However, I still have "waiting to be graded" in the assessment panel. I had an issue with someone thinking I'd plagiarized my essay (!) but that's sorted now, so I don't understand where my mark/marks are... I assume I get 0/15 from the person who flagged my essay, so I know I have at least one mark to view!

Thank you :)!

Charlie>
340:<Hi Sonia,
You can find the peer review on the side where the units are, under the homework essay 1. You will practice on 2 peer grading then start the actual peer grading on 4 different essays. Hope this helps you :)

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>.>
341:<Hi,

yesterday I submitted my essay and after first receiving the error with "bad id" I now could review others' essays. I repeatedly read about the wrong number of reviews being assigned to accounts, but I don't even know where to look for this. I submitted 4 reviews so far and hoped to have completed everything. Can you point me to where I can find this information? Thank you in advance :-)

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
342:<The Manuscript was limited to 25 pages.  That will translate to under 10 pages in print. :) <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>

344:<My comments were in no way meant as a criticism of the course, the staff or even the system; I merely expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that these multiple posts were deliberate and hoped that the staff would somehow be able to de-clutter the discussion board. 

Thanks to those who supported my viewpoint - and to Sudarshan who achieved something I didn't manage on registration and spelt my name right :)>
345:<Oh guys, I found out why we can't access the "Assignment 2 - Peer review" page. It will be available only from Novembe 1st! It is written in the last course update...we just have to be patient and wait! :)>
346:<Thanks very much :)!>
347:<I think you may find that the system sometimes resets scores to zero. I had this happen to me when I was reviewing someone's essay and didn't realise until I had pressed submit already. If you had read any of the other threads about this in the discussion forum you would have realised it isn't because people thought you had plagiarised the article you were reviewing.

Just wanted to say well done for including the article reference. Many essay I read hadn't done this :)>
348:<Is it the total for essays or for the course you are looking at? The essays contribute only so much to the final grade so the overall component will be further reduced as it will also be averaged with zero

Hope that makes sense :)>
349:<A much clearer explanation than mine :)>
350:<They will be available from November 1st! I'm waiting, too! =)>
351:<Congratulations, Emilio!

353:<Because this topic has been opened, I must say that your peer evaluation, my dear colleagues, really makes me laugh. To give 0 points or maximum 2 points on the entire essay, it seems that you have not learned a bit from this wonderful course. Well, I am not saying it was perfect, but, this is a part of a PhD (not published yet) but approved by 2 academic commissions with honors mentions. 
p.s.: when you correct such a 'thing' please try to stay focus on your grammar first :)))>
354:<Hi Patricia, I hear you too. Definitely a sad hater or an irresponsible student. Indeed, these people who gave low scores normally left without comments. But the people who spent time on the editing of our writing gave high marks. Hope we will be lucky for the next essay. :)>
355:<Isaac, many thanks for this useful link :)>
356:<Speaking about avoiding acronyms, specially unexplaid ones, would you kindly explain what you mean by a MOOC? :)>
357:<Thanks. :-)>
358:<In the end I wrote "Revised/edited introduction from [citation]" then just got down to it and included the relevant citations from the original... hopefully the reviewers put some brain cells into action! :p>
359:<Thanks, Micahela! I thought it was because of that... Anyway, it is so good to know I am not alone:) It is 19.40 here, so, technically, November 1 is almost over!>
360:<I also left the messageboxes full of greens and reds when I reviewed, but received few myself. But don't be upset, people left few comments maybe because they didn't think your essays have any flaw; I mean, you did so much in your work and even got a master of english to revise it, there's no way your writing can be scored poorly!  I was chased by another deadline (to write a report)then and didn't devote much in this writing, now your works are making me more uneasy =P

BTW, that 0 you got must be an mistake; it was stated prior to peer grading that only blank or plagiary deserve zeros.>
361:<You have to be patient.
You shouldn't be disappointed.
Just do your part of the job as seriously as possible.
This is not your fault if there are peers that are not as serious as you.
By doing the editing work you will learn a lot.
If some other peers have not understood that... too bad for them.
Keep doing a good work. :)>
362:<Hey, I received an answer to my mail a few hours ago and the problem is solved now... and the deadline extended, as you may have already seen! 

Thank you, staff members, for the work you're doing. We all understand this is a quite new course and some technical issues have to be fixed, but we're enjoying it and you're doing the best for making it work :-)

(Now it's time for the students to respect their peers' work and take the review process seriously... they will find reviewing is also constructing! And some day they might find themselves reviewing a manuscript in a scientific journal, or a book chapter... so everything you learn today can be really valuable in the future!!)>
363:<Thanks :)>
364:<Take it easy, it is fun and continuous education experience that it should all about. I myself very new to grade someone's scientific writing, it is difficult to be 100% fair although I wish that, but we are here to learn. Tasting the article and give a critique is very technical and subjective process even you tried your best at this level. I had the same same experience: one peer very degraded my work without constructive comment, and the other one's comment was very informative. And I myself degraded someone for the topic being very technical, rough and hard to follow for example although I wished to give him or her 3 in all sections. I did my best to be honest and I am here to learn.
 never give up, just keep learning :)>
365:<A content editor is the one who takes a 50-page manuscript and turns it into a 5-page article, making it more concise, stylish, clear, uncluttered and focused... :)>
366:<You're welcome and glad you're feeling better now :)>
367:<I don't want to doubt about other researchers' opinion, but I have a couple of questions:

I received a minimum score on my submission (and this is realistic :-) ), but there are not motivations, there are not corrections and there are not insertions. Is it correct? I can reject an article without a motivation ?

I received another low score (not minimum) with an unique note : [it's to specific, not for wide audience; sounds in some areas like introduction rather than summarizing article]. No corrections, no insertions, again. Is this possible?

I wonder if this was the mean goal of this exercise... I though we have to learn how to write and how to read an article, and , later, how to correct it. I receive in 2/3 cases no correction, but only a low score (maybe from a too lazy or too bored collegue?).>
368:<i also faced the same problem..
my first grader has given me 1 in all the points system..
no corrections done no comments done..
no feedback..

i think my grader was too lazy to correct or atleast tell me what i did wrong to improve...
well M JUS GLAD he dint put the ZERO grade in all)!!..

well luckily my 2nd grader and my 3rd grader were a lil impressed so got a reasonable grade!!

doubt if this exercise helps!!
or we rather get our course teacher to grade us (if its not too much trouble)!! ;)

yes??? wat say :)>

I had never heard "nitch" before the Preofessor used it, I was used to "neesh" - it is obviously a borrowing from French. Yet, who can doubt what the dictionary (and a good one!) says :)?>
374:<True, 'open ended problems' sounds as though there are no definite solutions possible. :-)

Perhaps some of the lessons from this course can be applied, and a simpler term can be used. Like "Assignments", for instance.>
375:<There was one "essay" I came across, which was just one small paragraph of about 100 words. The other 600 words were just citation...  :)>
376:<What was the topic? I want to pretend the reviewer was me. ;)>
377:<For me, what's upsetting is not getting a harsh grade, but rather - getting little or no feedback. Out of 9 reviews I got by now (after resubmitting the first essay), 5 contained no comment at all. 

When I did my own reviewing, after first skimming through the text I found some sections unclear or weird - it's provoking to just cut the points and move forward to the next essay. But once I tried to improve the sentences or the flow of ideas, I discovered how hard it was sometimes to get rid of the passive voice or repetition etc. Several times, I actually found out that it was me not understanding the text rather than a problem with the text itself. I really learned a lot from editing the other students' writing. 

So my plea is: don't just mark, but edit the text too! 

For the author's benefit and yours as well:)>
378:<thanks :)>
379:<Thanks :)>
380:<I just looked at my progress and saw that my grade so far consists of three components: Homework, quizzes and writing assignments. However if I add up the maximum sizes of all three bars in the final grade, I just get a maximum total of (10% + 20% + 50% =) 80%. Is there another thing involved that isn't included yet or is this an error?>
381:<I agree! You are right! :)>
382:<In my previous MOOCs the final is delayed to prevent answers from leaking out:)>
383:<I guess the lazy ones do not bother with discussion forums :)>
384:<Although its a couple of weeks away I'd like to express my thanks before the course closes. I have thoroughly enjoyed the course and find that my writing style has changed substantially - hopefully I'll continue to remember the tips and not drift back into my 'clutter-ful' ways. Unfortunately, this means I am now spending time reviewing many of my work documents :)

Yes, there have been technical issues but this has meant there has been a sense of support in the discussion forums that probably wouldn't have appeared had everything worked perfectly (you may gather that I'm an optimist!). The majority of those using the forums have been friendly despite their frustrations and I do hope that staff will spend some time considering the suggestions for improvement that have been posted by various people (I'm not going to add to my list here!).

Personally, this has been a positive learning experience and hasn't put me off participating in further learning of this type. My thanks go to staff and forum participants for giving me this opportunity.>
385:<That's true... but who knows, maybe they reward to the chosen person with trip to somewhere.... :)>

389:<Having just finished the peer review for Assignment 2, I must admit that the quality of essay has certainly improved since the last assignment :) Congratulations to Dr. Sainani on delivering a very effective course and to the students for their hardwork. 

However, I have some remarks to add. 

Before submitting your essay:

1. Please check if you are submitting your final version, not half-baked drafts or notes.  I read at least 3 essays which had incomplete sentences and notes-to-self, one even had bullet points to expand later for the final draft! 

2. Please read your sentences carefully during revision and at least put in **missing verbs**, even if you can not think of other improvements. Without verbs, it is very difficult to understand the sentence and the reviewer can not suggest an edit. 

Before submitting peer review: 

 1. Please make sure the scores are what you intended to be before you submit your review. You might be in a hurry and might not pay attention to the scores but it matters a lot to the writer who is anxiously waiting for the results of his hardwork. **RULE OF THUMB**: *First give scores and then give comments in the editing space below.* If you reverse this order, the grader resets to random scores, not the ones you gave earlier, resulting in good essays getting very low scores unintentionally. 

 2. Please PLEASE **PLEASE** devote some time to suggesting edits and writing comments! Even a small (Great work, keep it up!) or (Meh! it was boring!) would suffice even if you don't have anything important to add. Please don't rush through the essays; someone has spent a lot of time writing it for you to read.>
390:<Hi there :)

In the peer grading of writing assignment 2 I got a peer review that give 1 in all the criteria, but in the feedback he said the first paragraph was really good, the second had a few grammatical errors and that I used less than 300 words. This really deserves 1 in all criteria or it could have been some kind of error? Also, another peer review gave me 3 in 4 criteria and 1 in clarity, and in the feedback just said "very good!". I don't understand if this is "true" or some kind of error.  

P.S. My writing assignment is an introduction of a review I'm currently writing. I just forgot to mentioned that when I submitted the essay!>
391:<Thought this was quite interesting, although it would have been better with citations ;)

392:<this is true, thanks for your comment! :) but I think the course still can be improved in this way. Why can't they oblige students to review each work by making at least some corrections, not just grade it? This would help a lot + it will actually make them read.>
393:<Hello!

401:<I agree. And to me, the audience for these assignments is a lay person, so I try to write in a way my family will understand. :)>
402:<Hi,

I think one important thing are "the rules of the game". And this game says (again and again, in the posts, in the course description and so on..) : 300-500.
Less or more would be like who submits does not respect the rest of us who counted and recounted over and over again (and rephrased) just to play fair. 
Five or 10 words would not be (such) a big deal. For the rest, either way, essays are considered incomplete (i.e., if you stopped correcting after the 500th word). 

In most Universities you are penalized if you do not follow these rules. Some have "boxes" where you put your answer that disallow/reject longer texts; i'm sure most of us have already experienced that. They base their policy on the principal that the person who does so, does not respect neither his fellow students, nor the reviewer who will be correcting their "1,500 (!!)" words.

As i  said, to me, it is a matter of principle

Best,

:) -T>
403:<It happened to me too. The reviewer commented "[Excellent :)]" in my essay but he/she graded my essay's clarity, concision, and style zeros. He/she gave my organization and focus 3s though. I believe these zeros are not intended--the same error happened.

I proposed that the 4th review is used to substitute the "unfair" grading due to the error (our essay was reviewed by 4 people).

Suggestion for the future: the default option should be blank instead of zero. If there are blanks in grading, the system prevents the reviewer submitting his/her grading and gives a warning.>
404:<How about conveying an idea succinctly in 80 words? In 3 words? Yes we can. If we're writing for ourselves, there's no limit - upper or lower. But that's not the case here. There is a particular specification stated and we need to write to that. Here is an exercise: how about a science essay of *exactly* 300 words? Good ones will be works of language art as well! :-)>

422:<In revising the writing assignments 1 and 2 of my peers I found -in at least 3 essays- that the "instructions for authors" (the assingment instructions) are NOT met. For example: a) the words are much less than 300 and/or b) the writing of the essay does not match with any of the suggestions given by the teacher. For example in assignemnt 1 i recieved an essay on Dolphins when the suggestions where to write about a published paper or a person in science. The current metrics for measuring the output of the assignments has to incorporate a item where the instructions are met, in a similar way than in plagiarism (e.g. being able to flag a essay that does not meet the instructions). Accomplishing the instructions for authors is a vital aspect of the publication process so I would suggest that a metric for this aspect is incorporated in the current way of grading. Hope my comment helps! :) I love the course and find it super exciting, this is a comment only to imporve it furhter!>

439:<I can now see the window :)

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
440:<Your comment addresses an issue that I was thinking about, too. In fact, I also chose *'half'* at first---making this my second or third wrong answer in the whole course. Anyway, I (now) think the answer *'half'* lacks an important information: How much is the change? For example, people would regarded the drug as much more effective if it reduces the risk from 50 to 25% (unrealistic, indeed) than from to 0.02 to 0.01% (some would probably not care about). The statement *'half'* is therefore only a minor information gain---independent of whether I address a mass or an individual. It's like slicing a (piece of) cake: I'm much more interested to get the half cake than half of a 1/16th. Of course: at least I get something (e.g., half a crumb :-) ). From this point of view, answer *b* appears much more vivid (although the initial '*0.3 to 0.15%'* would still be more clear to me).>
441:<Hmm, you fared better than I-- one of my reviewers complained about the language, then suggested grammatically incorrect edits that made a hash of my text. Unfortunately, by this stage, our peers are probably rushing through their required edits to get their essays graded.

Your best bet now would be to connect with colleagues to read each others' writing. 

If only we could grade our peer reviewers ;)>
442:<Hi Jennifer,

The fact i didn't mention it, doesn't mean i didn't get incorrect edits on my 1st essay at 1st submission, which made the phrase ..totally unrecognizable. 

What i care about (and solely) finally is what i've learned through this course, and it was enormous! If i only took it before i had submitted an article a couple of months ago..!

Best, 

:) -T

ps= yes! grade them, and have fun :))>
443:<One of the lessons to learn from that course is, that some reviewers don't really know how to do their job :-) (No offense meant ;-) )
Have you read anything written by your PhD supervisor?

On the other hand one need to take into account that strong verbs are sometimes uncommon; since many potential readers are very often not English native speakers one need to be careful not to use too complicated verbs. Maybe that was his intention to change some of the verbs to the simple "be"?>
444:<I'm affraid, i'll disagree with you: i graded a couple of 15s with minor corrections, and explained the "how-s and why's"; and suggested what i thought might improve in any aspect (even References, grammar, vocabulary, and more, and did not "cut" any grade for such corrections, as it was not what we were to grade). 
As we could all notice, next to the 3 grades were "some clutter" for example: meaning that it deserved a 3; i did not forget the effort they made!

448:<Great post, Michaela.

>  I don't know the answer to making everyone do it correctly

Well, there's no incentive for doing reviews correctly, and no penalty for botching it up. Therein lies a possible solution.

If some % of the score is reserved for feedback feedback (is this a phrase? :-)), it can motivate / force people to take the process more seriously. It could even be an "above and beyond" mention. 

For instance, if I could write "Provided detailed and useful feedback!" and it could appear on the profile or the statement of accomplishment of the reviewer, that could be a nice incentive for some. 

Being a free mooc, any solution has to be participant-driven as there are few practical ways for this to scale using course staff alone.>
449:<Yeah, it would be great to hear from engineering too :)>
450:<Each person has his own perks when writing...and especially professors. Their editing comments will be related to their writing style. When it's your supervisor you may be able to pose some argument but not much I suppose :) 
But writing style is very unique for each person, and we understand things better the way we write them and we would like to edit stuff to the way we like them...that is a fact. I understood it the first time I received comments on something I wrote. To me it made sense the way I wrote it and it made absolutely no sense the way my supervisor suggested I should write it...this course was great because it demonstrated some objective techniques!>

I understand the issues that you explain. But it will be greatly helpful for us to extend even with 50% penalty! Please consider this request very kindly.

:)>
510:<My two cent:

1) every reviewer should be as polite as it is possible. Everything else is unprofessional. 

2) you should fully ignore the tone of the reviewer. Do not expect the comments to tell you exactly what to change and how. The comment can be already useful if it just points out where you have lost the reader. If you are in doubt how to write it better, then watch the videos again. In exaggeration: even the comments of an idiot can be very useful to improve the text, because where he got lost in the text, some other reader whould may get irritated, too.

In this respect an insult could be better then no comment. Of course it needs a little training to see it that way :-)>

525:<Can't agree more. It did not happen to me - my reviews were always helpful so thank you guys :) But if you encountered such rude behaviour - nothing to discuss. It should not happen among the elite - and us - the educated ones are the elite so we should behave with proper manners.>
526:<You are very welcome! A few minutes here and there to help others takes little effort, but gives much satisfaction. You are the ones who have to do the real work in learning. :)

Another one, just found from a MOOC link added to my thread, "Where do you find your MOOCS?"

**A beginners’ guide to writing in English for university study**

Learn how to use English for study at university or college and develop your writing skills, vocabulary and grammar.
"We have developed this course to help you learn the basics of academic writing and develop your English skills for study in the UK, US, Australia or other countries where English is used."

It says it starts February 17, but I'm not sure if that means 2013, or 2014.

529:<There are +2 votes already. Perhaps there is an audience for a "Flirting in the Sciences" MOOC... :)>
530:<The title is quite philosophical, Taiko. :-)>
531:<Or comic prose perhaps :)>
532:<:) -?>
533:<One is him voting for himself :)) -T>
534:<Congrats!! :) -T>
535:<What I liked in the peer reviews - is overall correction of "s" to "z", like in word "analysing".
Here in Europe it is perfectly normal to use  "s", referring to British English, you guys ;)>
536:<...is lots of good reading. :-)

English is a beautiful language, thanks to its flexibility and growing vocabulary. The idioms, metaphors and other language structures provide richness to it, and good writing styles can be developed by reading different genres of literature.

Fortunately, writing is also a lot easier to master in English than the spoken form, which suffers from lack of phonetic consistency and intelligibility of myriad accents. No wonder English has become the language of modern science writing. What a turn around from the time of that great English scientist, Isaac Newton, who had to write all his major texts in Latin and Greek in order to get worthy peer reviews in those days!>
537:<this is a joke on the wrong place.. any way just to increase my vocabulary i really want to know what is a constant heart? :)>
538:<I believe grades, in the end, does not matter. If we learn what we meant to throught this course, I believe, we all have secured the distinction. Peer review system, however, should see some changes. All the best everyone. :)>
539:<I think the same, please!! Was a great course :D>
540:<Thanks for the great post! I appreciate the statistical distributions :) And I think this is a good example of how to raise your grade if you're trying to get a high score.>
541:<Professor Kristin Sainani,

Thank you for all your help, time and commitment. Many thanks to all your team members and Stanford University. Thank you for sharing with us your knowledge and experiences. 

I copy pasted Mey - plagiarism - but I could not put it any better myself. 
I am happy with the class a lot. And will take a class with you any time you organize it again :)>
542:<I am from Nepal :)>
543:<OMG, this discussion topic is too hilarious and gave a belly laugh. For a minute, i was wondering if this was an introduction section of a manuscript. Nice peer reviews and grades too, ROFL :-)>
544:<> luck definitely plays a role.

You're right, Petra. Doesn't it, in many things in life? :-)

It was plain luck that I even got to know about this course... :-)>
545:<Nice peer review conducted Beatrice :-)>
546:<Yes, "when" please.

Hope it looks Formal and Authentic enough  :-)>
547:<> Hope it looks Formal and Authentic enough :-)

548:<You were lucky Sudarshan :) and may be you got through reviewer like us, who even after giving suggestions to improve the essay gave a score between 13-15 depending upon the scope of improvement. But in turn got reviewers who did not bother to read essay, gave a score of 10 without even reading or providing any inputs to improve the essay. Assignment 3 saw worse reviewers who just gave 5 or 6 to essays without providing any comments. This was really unfair at their part.

Wish every one good luck for future. Thought missed the distinction with 2% still gained knowledge 100% which will remain with me throughout my life.

A big thanks to Prof. Sainani, I will use this knowledge entire my career.

550:<I've got Email from the Staff - they ask to check the full name (at the dashboard) before the 25-th Nov (they'll put it into the certificate/statement of accomplishment)and tell that we'll receive Certificate  Dec 2nd - a Happy Day :-))) 

They wrote: "You have until Sunday, November 24th at 11:59pm PST to make any changes to your Full Name. We anticipate that all Statements of Accomplishment will be generated and available via download from your Dashboard page by Monday, December 2nd. We will also send out a confirmation email when they are ready">

555:<Hi guys,
this is our class on youtube. I have noticed some questions about whether the content will be available. I do not have answer to this question, but I have found the videos of our class here:
http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wb-n89yM0lBiP2QltsDaA?feature=watch
While the class can be closed after due dates, this remains still available, and valuable a lot. 

Thank you Professor for this experience :)>
556:<Hello, Everyone!  Just finished taking the final exam and completed the course.  I really learned a lot over the past few weeks! :)  Anyway, good luck to everyone as they wrap things up. I had a great time working through the course and peer-reviewing essays. 

Again, good luck in the future and I hope to run into some of you in future courses!

557:<Thanks BeatriceM for posting the message here. I would have missed checking my email... that tells how glued was i to the course rather than my mailbox :p)>
558:<This really gave me a lift after feeling down for getting one of my correct answers marked wrong. I found the original post and many of the comments quite hilarious. Give the man some credit- what better place to find an intellectual partner? Nice job Beatrice and Robert:-)>
559:<I agree. :)>
560:<And in response to  "I Always Learn as I Age" ....I feel I am younger when I learn!

Never stop learning. :) If I keep this up, I will live to be 110!>
561:<I found this free checker really useful in identifying plagiarism http://smallseotools.com/plagiarism-checker/ - you simply paste the text in, and it runs a Google search for the entire text, in small chunks. It's a very simple tool but worth a try as it is free :)>
562:<Hi, I'd like to invite you to FB group for tandem peer reviewers :-)

563:<Hi, my final score was 92% :) I am happy. Professor, thank you very much!!>
564:<Hi, 
I am wondering if there's any information that could help me with these. English is my second language and this was one of the things that I often was confused about. 

When should we use in, on or at?  Particularly in this case: "please find the materials posted on the website" or "in the website"? 

Any general rules/guidance is appreciated it! 

Thank you! :-)

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
565:<Using Google's search results:

available at the website returns 72,800,000 results.
available on the website returns 106,000,000 results.

So "ON" is more popular :)>
566:<GREAT idea. I'm the first liking the page YAY ME :)>
567:<With 10 papers published, I have to say, I'm sticking with the ENdNote ;) Whether you use this program, or any other available out there, make sure it has 1) the cite while you write; 2) many formats for final Bibliography / is formatable according to your needs.>
568:<hehe thank you! :)>
569:<This is a bit late, BUT I find that if I want to connect with someone who is not in my LinkedIn "allowed to connect" group, I just say I know them as a colleague from any one of the companies I work/ed for. So far, success every time.  :)>
570:<Tx Beatrice, i did something alike the other day (already forgot it!) Good idea!

:) -T>
571:<Be patient... :)>
572:<The final test and the survey worked fine for me, even on my Android „Jelly Bean“ internal browser.

The content of the final test was rather simple. Only very few questions required me to think, and in those cases I found out that the questions were identical to the questions in former homework tests (which I answered correctly and therefore I could just copy the correct answer.) I've made 21 points, which did only count as 20 points in the test total :-)>
573:<A_L is right... All this can be found "in the search results". I remember reading about it "in a book", and it even appeared "in a newspaper". It was either "on the front page" or "in the inside pages"...

So guess the information is posted "**on** one of the pages **in** the website **at** www.confusion.con

BTW, until recently, there was no word called "website". It was supposed to be written as "web site". It was a clash of LitWriters and SciWriters, but eventually the latter prevailed.... :)

574:<Great Idea! I'm in! :)>
575:<I have the same problem here in Guatemala, I´ll Wait :D>
576:<Same in Poland :)>
577:<Same in New Zealand. We have to wait.... :)>
578:<Same here :)>
579:<Yesterday I've already bought the frame for the certificate :)>
580:<@NataliaPalil :D LOL>
581:<I didn't get that email, thanks a lot for the info :)>
582:<:) lol.. @nataliapalii @drduc... 

its 4rth of december..India>
583:<count me in too.. thou i am from delhi. we can b connected through social networking site or emails.:)>
584:<Thank you, Sudarshan! That is really helpful :) 

Interesting about the word website! I had no idea! Thank you for sharing!>
585:<Thank you Raleen and Rashidmd. English is my second language, so I often found these particular confusin! Like Sudarshan said below "in a newspaper" but "on the front page". I feel like "in" is used when it's "inside" but "on" is more "superficial" like.. "the glass is on the table" and "at" more location. But then once it comes to "Virtual" world" like "on the website" it's a bit confusing to me! thanks for all the replies!! :)>
586:<haha I love the transportation explanation! LOL.. not sure I fully believe it either! : )

The second post explanation is very good!! That's a great link! I like how you say in the end "best expresses your intended meaning" That actually helps clarify quite a bit on which one to use. .. for example "the pages IN the book" but the writing is ON the pages, the book is sitting "on" the shelf.

The distinction is starting to become clearer now! Thank you Raleen! :)>
587:<I agree with Beatrice too!
Although a misuse of this forum, it also made me smile :) hehe. My favorite part was "For her requirements, she will find all on me." Quite confident, Mr. Mohamed, Good for you! : )>
588:<Agreed! I guess a different form of online dating? hehe :)>
589:<Oops, perhaps they are processing them overnight - hopefully in the next 8-12 hours then for those that don't have them yet :)>
590:<Thank you very much, Oblivion2k13..my statement isn't available yet, but I hope I'll get it soon! :)>
591:<I've got my certificate :) 
I'm so happy !>
592:<you can down load your certificate now :)>
593:<Just got it :)>
594:<Surely, it would be wonderful - to get a Statement of accomplishment with grade (I've got 86 % - just 4 points  shy of distinction, alas).
Well, the Statement of accomplishment has A5 format (half of  A4), but a frame I've bought is for A4 list  - so I:
(1) made a snapshot of my dashboard with my final grade - 86% ,
(2) combine this snapshot and my Statement,
(3) printed this file on the A4 list of paper,
(4) put it into my A4 frame :) - it looks fairly well :-D>
595:<I'd also like to resit this course. :)>
596:<Can I still take this course? I saw it really late but it looks very interesting and like it'd be a great course to take. So just wondering...thanks. :)>
