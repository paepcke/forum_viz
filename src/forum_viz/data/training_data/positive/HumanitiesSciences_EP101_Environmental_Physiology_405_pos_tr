2:<Hi everyone! I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Lithuania. If You know that small country :) I am studying general practice nursing and I am glad that I have apportunity tu study this course.>
3:<Hello people!My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am from India.I am an undergraduate student doing BBA. I took up this course because I was curious to know how a human body responds in such extreme conditions. Nice to meet you all:)>
4:<Hello everyone! My name's <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I'm currently residing in Lithuania:) I'm interested in this course because I'm an avid traveler and just enjoy learning something new that might help me while planning or going on a trip.>
5:<Hello everyone,
I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Serbia. I am a medicine doctor and I teach pathophysiology at Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade. Besides, I am PhD student - Physiological sciences. Since this is physiology course with pathogenetic mechanisms, I found this topic really interesting. I hope it will help me to improve my knowledge about how environmental changes affects our organism :)
just started today, and so far I think it's great!

Thank You! :)>
6:<That's the reason for me too! I'm getting ready to do a few long trips and I thought this course just seemed to fit the situation! Please share any opinions and insights you find! :)>
7:<Hi! My name is Abhi and I live in San Diego. I am taking this course to learn more about the body and how the environment affects it - maybe it will help me understand my asthma and allergies better :)>
8:<I am excited about taking yet another Stanford course. I look forward to each week  to learn as much as possible about my body. And I am glad to be able to share my experience with the whole world :) >> Cheers from Polish girl in UK>
9:<I thought it would be useful to share some comments about the course directly on-line instead of sending thousands of emails to out tutors + they could maybe answer us in here right away :)>
10:<Hi everybody! 
My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I'm taking this course for fun, and in order to use some of the knowledge for my own activies (long-distance triathlons, living in Norway has some challenges as in adapting to cold conditions?? :D) and future activities (I really would lov to go hiking in high altitues).

I'm also interested in the physiology of the body in reaction to stress. Since I think I react more to stress than the average person, my body lets me know for sure!

So I maybe I'll learn some useful things here, I'm looking forward to watching the videos, that's for sure :)>
11:<Hello Everyone, my name is also Abe :) I am from Mexico, and I am posting in order to get the credit!! 

cheers>
12:<While listening to Professor Anne's discussion, I couldn't help travelling back to one of the dramatic scenes of the movie Titanic where Rose and Jack were in their very own moments of hypothermia thus lead me to the following conclusions:

 1. Jack died and Rose survived because Jack was soak in the cold water where he is losing heat 25 times faster than Rose was losing heat at the time.
 2. Apparently, Rose had more subcutaneous fats than Jack.
 3. Rose got more non-cottony clothes than Jack.
 4. Rose had longer hair :)>
13:<Hi, I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from India, taking this course for fun. Hope everyone else gets to learn a lot from it too. :)>
14:<Nice to follow up the videos, living in germany kind of get me used to cold temperatures, anyone around HH? :)>
15:<Hi, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I live and work in the Highlands of Scotland.  Of course, I also play here - mostly mountain biking.  I mountain bike all year round and as I'm preparing for an endurance race in the summer, and as I frequently fatigue on short, intense activity and at different rates depending on conditions, I thought I'd take this course to find out more about what is going on.  Also, I love learning so here I am, undertaking the first of four MOOCs I've enrolled for so far this year.  I'm looking forward to working with you over the next six weeks. :)>
16:<EP101 Staff: Your wish is our command :)  There will be a little bit on this topic in the bonus module in the aging section title "exercise and the common cold". It was part of the physical activity, disease and aging section, but was moved out to its own section because the original lecture was getting too long.  The bottom line is that infections go up in the winter because of the short, cold, dry days which help viruses survive and the reduction in Vit D formed in the skin by the sun. Also, everyone is stuck together inside spreading germs.  There seems to be mixed data on whether cold increases risk of infection.  That idea was "debugged" some time ago, but some more recent evidence suggests that maybe the cold,dry air irritates the ventilatory passages of athletes training outdoors which make them more susceptible to infections. Once you have a cold, I like CanBahtiyar's brainstorming above: More heat loss with a fever and divided resources.>
17:<Hi everyone. I'm from England and taking the course partly because the subject fascinates, partly because I'm always trying to broaden my knowledge, but mainly because I am already doing a physiology degree, so it ties in well :)

I look forward to more discussions with you all over the next 6 weeks.

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>.>
18:<Form the physical point of view, how those avacore devices can be beter than a bucket of hot water with some mustard powder dissolved? That's how we warm up in Siberia anyway :-)>
19:<Hi everybody :)

My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I'm studying Mechanical Engineering in Poland. 
I'm taking part of this course because I always like to broaden my knowledge and also I think that human physiology is fascinating and worth closer attention.

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
20:<I think some of the other online classes in here do have this function, but I do not think this class offers it.  lets look forward for their improvement :)  good luck on the class!!>
21:<EP101 Staff: Thank you for the suggestion.  We have included some of the terms in the Glossary both alphabetically (part 1) and in order of appearance (Part 2).  Perhaps it would help to keep the glossary open in a different browser so you can pause the video and then check the glossary.  We were actually hoping to have the terms hyperlinked to the video, but haven't been able to figure that out yet. Maybe next time :)>
22:<Good question.  The head is a major source of heat loss because it has a lot of vessels and, unlike the other extremities, your body does not restrict blood flow to your head as much - Your brain would be pretty unhappy with that situation.  Also, It often remains exposed even in the cold.  Thus, we have the advice that one of the best things you can do to stay warm is put a hat on.  Definitely, some wisdom in that although I don't think I would exchange all the rest of my clothes for JUST a hat. :)>
23:<Hi everyone, my name is **Badit** and I am from the **Philippines**. I am a Software Engineer. Yup, this course has nothing to do with my undergraduate degree (Computer Science!) I enrolled in this course because I love the great outdoors - mountains, trails, beaches, sun, sand, salt water, everything! and I also love to travel. I know this course will come in handy. Oh, and I practice yoga everyday, too :) Looking forward to some interesting discussions!>
24:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I live in Colorado and do a bit of ultra running. I have a race in Alaska coming up in 33 days, so I am KEENLY interested in the cold chapters :)>
25:<There is no age limit for this course.  I'm thinking through the material in my head and nothing so far makes it out of the PG range :). Your kids are welcome and I hope they enjoy the experience.  I'd be excited to hear from them on the discussion as to whether the material is interesting and understandable for them.
Cheers.>
26:<hi, i think the **redistribution of the very cold blood from the extremities to the core has also a role in the fast cooling.**

When Corey is on the treadmill the heart pumps more to send oxygen to the muscles. And when the (cold) blood goes back from the muscles (periphery) to the thorax (core) it mixes with central core warm blood. Here is the quick cooling issue.

Let's go to the following mini-lectures to get more explanations :)>
27:<I feel comfortable in colder climates than warmer climates.  I noticed this as I aged.
But talking with people my age they usually prefer to be warmer, wearing heavy coats.
I think I'm backwards in this process of aging. :)>
28:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Mexico. I'm taking the course because I became super interested in the physiology of scuba diving - and mountain climbing, and what happens to the body upon these environmental changes. I'm a PhD student in cell biology of malaria, in Switzerland - so this course is more of a hobby :) Nice to meet you all.>
29:<Hi my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, and I'm a student at Stony Brook University! Happy to be taking this class with all of you :)>
30:<Hi I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Kenya (East Africa). Currently doing an internship before before setting off for pilot training
Taking the course mostly for the fun of it because I found it to be rather interesting. :-)>
31:<As an avid hiker I've found my hands, feet and head cold and numb from time to time.  However, I'll never forget the Escape from Alcatraz swim where my right hand stopped working due to the cold temperatures.  I managed to swim with a "broken paddle" and finish the race in 30 minutes, but there were moments I thought I'd need to quit and ride in on a kayak.  Once out of the water I became colder and shivered for a very long time.  After an hour, when my lips were no longer blue,  I could contemplate the experience . . . then walk across the street for Ghirardelli chocolate :).
I'm taking this course for fun and to gather useful information to take on the trails/ outdoor adventures.>
32:<Watching 'Corey Gets Cold' video I couldn’t help thinking that his body response might be influenced by not only temperature of air or water, but also by being aware of being watched/filmed. I wonder if dynamic of his body temperature would be different should he be on his own? I know that diving in icy cold water is much easier (and warmer) when someone is watching you:).>
33:<Hello all! I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, originally from Lebanon working in Saudi Arabia. This course attracted my attention since I am planning on achieving some extreme adventurous expeditions such as hiking Kilimanjaro next year. So It would be helpful knowing how the body works and reacts and what to expect. in such conditions. Hope this course meets our needs and expectations. :)>
34:<Hi! My name is Maurílio. I'm from Brazil, where I started my course of Biology 3 years ago. Nowadays I'm studing English in Australia. I think that participating in this Physiology's course I would improve my writting skills.  :)>
35:<Hey, my Name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am originally from Romania, but currently living in Austria. It's a really interesting course, as the human Body is so strong but yet so fragile at the same time :) 
Hope we all enjoy the course!>
36:<Hi, sorry to add a question about technical issue here but i'd like to share a small "pitfall"

As non english speaking native i find very useful that you put the closed caption. But **it's really hard to sway between the CC and the video**. Having the CC at the bottom of the video would be easier i think

btw, **the highlighting of the CC synced with your talk is super cool** :)

thanks a lot>
37:<Hi Meisha,

I live not in a warm place, but anyway such an experience is brutal for me :)>
38:<Hi, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Spain. Looking forward to aplying these learnings to myself! :)>
39:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and i'm studying in order to be a nurse and i'm also really interested in the course! 
Bye Bye :)>
40:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I'm working as a physiotherapist in out patient clinic and I'm really intersted in this course. I hope to improve my knoweledge and get many practical informations about dealing with stress :)>
41:<very intresting :)>
42:<Yarr, that, plus a hot drink/soup inside. 
Come to think of it, a shot of vodka (once out of cold, and not until then) seems to work well (I suppose in part by dilating peripheral capillaries (red nose and all :-) 

But here is something interesting I just found: 

"when subjects' heads were submerged in cold water, it led to a disproportional drop in the body's internal, or core, temperature. This is likely because certain parts of the head - the ears, nose and cheeks - have specialized blood vessels that play a direct role in cooling or warming the body's internal organs. The same blood vessels are present in the palms and the soles of the feet. Even a relatively small amount of heat loss through these surfaces, the scientists found, impacts the entire body's internal temperature.

Stanford scientists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn discovered that people can use this principle to their benefit, especially when overheated by heavy exercise. Heller and Grahn created the CoreControl, a vacuum-sealed cooling device. Athletes insert their hands, and the machine lowers the internal temperatures of their entire bodies. Several college and pro football teams use CoreControl on the sidelines to help hot, tired players get back on the field. (Source: www.avacore.com/technology/how-it-works)"

Very interesting. Perhaps this implies some reflexologic action? 
Evidently a similar device may be designed for ears nose and other important body appendages :-)

" All mammals have "radiators," specific regions of the body surface designed for dissipating excess heat from the body core to the environment - think of a dog's tongue, or rabbits' ears. Blood is preferentially pumped to these surfaces when metabolism increases as it does during exercise. In humans, some of these radiator surfaces are found in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. When an athlete gets hot, blood flow naturally increases through these skin regions to dissipate heat through specialized blood vessels called arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs)."

That sounds related to mammalian diving reflex.>
43:<I never get used to the cold :)>
44:<Bonjour !

I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I live in Lille, a large city in the northernmost part of France. I'm taking this class because I am awed by the incredible adaptability of the human body - and the unbelievable plasticity of the human brain, but that's another story - and I am looking forward to learning more about it. 

I practice Nordic walking, cycling and roller-skating all year round; it means that depending on the time of year, I have to be ready to ride my bike or walk in quite cold (-7°C or 20°F) to quite hot (32°C or 90°F) weather, so everything I will learn here I intend to put to good use in order to stay safe and make the experience more enjoyable. 
I can't wait to get to know myself better thanks to you :)>
45:<Totally agree with you :)>
46:<So far, so good

CC very useful, great idea. But maybe it should be on the bottom of the video.

Looking forward to further videos :)>
47:<Hello, Larry, nice to meet you. Hi from Ukraine :)>
48:<My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am a school director in Germany. I am taking this course just for fun. And it will be a great challenge for me, regarding my skills in English language. And by the way: I am more the "couch-potatoe"-type, but maybe at the end of the course I will get better along with my body and my age. Nice to meet you all :-)>
49:<hi Joe i hope that we all enjoy the class :)i'm interested in how the body handel the stress as well because i usually get stress attack that i don't understand them so maybe now it will be more clear>
50:<hi Loki i'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and we share the same love for science :)>
51:<I really like the class even though I need to spend so much time checking dictionary about those difficult words :-)>
52:<this minilecture, among 7 modules, caught the most of my attention
I guess the words like risk, death, and such, command me to be attentive :)>
53:<Halo everyone, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, from Indonesia. I'm exactly still in senior high school.

Oh yeah, my English isn't very good, so with this international online course, I hope I can improve it.

Maybe I'll need your help, guys. And as far as I can, I'll help you. Thanks :)>
54:<Thank you very much, Niall. Your example has been very clear to solve my doubt. Thanks a lot! :-)>
55:<So here comes my first post, sorry for the sort of "graphis" picture ;)

So I went on a hike with a friend on a sunny but cold day (minus 12C) in january 2013. Although I was dresse apropriately, we were walking through deep snow, making our own path.
Eventually we wanted to stop for food and warm tea, and in order to get a sunny spot, we also chose the WINDY spot. BIG mistake.

We enjoyed the view, but man, it was soooo cold!
We couldn't even sit down because the wind was so cold.
So I lost the feelings in my toes (I do that a lot - I also have cold feet when being inside - always have had) so we had to shorten our lunch break and walk on.

More feeling gone in my toes and feet, and since we were now walking downhill, I didnt't get warm inside. We started to jog - me reasoning that increasing blood flow to my toes would help.

Our "jog" home took 30min (still no feelings in my FEET - kind of weird to walk on numb feet). Coming home, my toes looked like on the photo.
Ouch.
I warmed them up gently, and luckily, no further damage.
Bit the white skin was really odd to touch. stiff, kind of.

Now I wonder - although there was no obvious damage, I've heard that once you've had frostnip/frostbite, you will have it again faster then before.
Is that true?
Would that mean that there is actually a bit of a damage to the small blood vessels?

Second question: Wise decision to jog down the mountain?

Btw, my toes on the left feet were worst, since they are kind of odd shaped a little bit. My boots are bigh enough, but I really loose feeling very easily in my left toes #3,4 and 5.

Anynone hasany suggestions to the questions?

56:<Happy new year too, Ana. Nice to know you :)>
57:<I am impressed with the variety of  countries everyone is from!
I thought the class was only for the U.S. I am honored to be
in connection with the world! :)
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
58:<Hi everyone,
this is the 2nd on-line class from SU I'm doing it and love it. As someone that works with sick people all the time, it is very good to know  the changes the human body does in the relations of hot, cold, stress....Hope to do well and use it at the hospital :)>
59:<Having watched this, I am fairly certain I was in the latter stages of mild or possibly the very early stages of moderate hypothermia after doing Tough Guy (the original Tough Mudder) in January last year.

It was a very cold day, below freezing overnight, just above when we actually did the event. The first runners actually had to break the ice on the water obstacles! After that it was floating in chunks, was a good couple of inches thick.

Then, about halfway through the wind picked up which was awful as we were wet and tired already.

The organisers had to reroute parts of the event as they were having so many hypothermic people needing attention, about one a minute apparently but that could be exaggerated. It took us about 2 and a half hours to finish so you can imagine we were pretty cold by the end!

I remember going through all the stages Corey did: violent shivering, loss of coordination etc and also some cognitive impairment too - my friend I was running with had a *yellow* hat on, lost it in one of the underwater stages, then asked the girl next to him if he still had an *orange* hat on, because he couldn't work it out himself!

Afterwards we were given hot chocolate and a biscuit which was just awesome as Corey noted, instantly helped with the coldness, though some people were shivering so violently they spilt it all.. then under a warm shower to clean off before getting into some dry clothes and off to the pub.

Awesome experience, a bit dangerous but very life-affirming in the end.

TL;DR: can confirm a lot of the info from the videos, I am crazy :)>
60:<EP101 Staff:  Thanks for you concern about Corey :)  The object that was down his throat was an esophageal temperature probe. It is a narrow wire that goes in his nose, down his throat and stops in his esophagus. That allowed us to measure his core temperature at the level of his chest.  It is much less invasive than a nasogastric tube and doesn't go all the way to his stomach. It is used frequently in research with no ill effect.  It is not easy to get in, but not painful. Corey was a trooper and had no problem!>
61:<Thanks, Jeremy. I'll forward this to the technical team.  I can imagine people all over the world swearing at this small, but annoying, characteristic. :)>
62:<Hi guys!

This was a really interesting video.

I just wanna share my experience with you. When I play soccer in the winter time, my hands get super cold. Now, I know why :-)

So probably, I should use gloves.

I'm thinking probably feet get cold, too. So better use 2 or 3 pairs of socks.

Have you experienced problem playing soccer in the winter time?

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
63:<I don't know how much room there is for true science in a popular TV program, but I was perplexed by the ability of the former Navy SEAL to conquer the obstacle course and then shoot accurately after 60 minutes in 55 degree water.
(See Youtube videos: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcpGHeNGgI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX0bJVkWv6g
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ieBlnvxmk
the action starts at 3:25 mins into the first video)

I think it is probably because of his training (flexing muscles, keeping his limbs close together, etc.) that he can keep his core temperature up (and the water does not seem to be circulating either!).  However, he does not seem to have too much trouble with his fine motor skills considering his shooting at the end.  From the class I would expect him to be affected.  Any comments?>
64:<I haven't been playing soccer, but this happend to me several times. Now it happens when I go jogging. It is time for us to buy a pair of gloves, friend =)>
65:<The first introductory videos reminded me very much of a Canadian researcher, Gordon Giesbrecht,  who studies hypothermia and the effects of extreme cold temperatures on the body (which earned him his nickname, Professor Popsicle).  

Here is a link to a series of videos titled "Survival in the Ice" that were made to inform the public on what to do in potentially dangerous situations that involve cold temperatures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gOW8ZaYqHA&list=PL3972A83FA876D899

Living in Winnipeg (known to many as "Winter-peg" and where last week our temperature was reportedly lower than that on the surface of Mars), the videos on the physiological responses to cold have proved very interesting. 

Keep up the great work!>
66:<I can imagine!  I would rather be hot any day!  :)>
67:<Hey, Corey!

I suppose you will forevermore empathize quite a bit with lab rats. :)>
68:<Hello Everyone:

 I currently live in Wisconsin. My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am taking this course so that it will help me to prepare for the Human Physiology course I will be taking in medical school in the fall. Nice to meet you all. :D>
69:<Greetings from The Netherlands. I am a naturopath, too and I'm also very interested in learning more about our human body. :)>
70:<Hi Jose. I know what you mean. I have a certain dislike for cold, but only if not properly dressed ;)

All along, I have been impressed by the different swimmers crossing the English channel, covered in thick layers of grease but arriving at the English coast, having lost more than 10 pounds of body weight. I hope we can touch on this kind of physilophical side effect because I think it is a amazing way to illustrate how bodies react in so many different ways. Thank you for sharing your story too!>
71:<Hello, 
interesting fact, please update us if you find out more.

I have often encountered that kids at a young age do not have the subjective feeling of being cold, so this phenomenon may last longer until hormones and nervous system fully develop their tasks.

Kid's bodies seem to be similar this way, because in my circle of friends who have kids, it is an ongoing discussion with young human beings ;) of all ages before teenage-hood, to wear insulating clothing but being refused by saying "we are not cold" but then returning with the sniffles or a cold. But still, in fact, not feeling cold.>
72:<The acute cold response includes tachycardia (increased heart rate), which increases the cardiac output (Fick's equation), thus increasing the metabolic demand. 75% of the energy used is given off as heat and voila - you feel warmer! :)>
73:<Hi everyone!!

My names <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm a 3rd year post-graduate student studying Medicine at Melbourne University, here in Australia. I have 1 year of medical school to complete! I have a Bachelors in Biomedical Science & a Science honours degree.

Excited to learn new things here with SU

:) <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
74:<Those story videos are great! Seeing everything happening and being applied to "real life situations" really makes it easier to understand, but at the same time it gives me a little agony to see Corey "suffering". Luckily everything ends well so keep it up :)>
75:<Hi everyone! my name is Helen. I am a student of Geography, I`m from Belarus :)>
76:<Yes Marilyn. Some of the days during this project I felt a bit more like a mouse than a budding scientist :) I have a new level of empathy for research subjects, animal or human. 

Happy and honored to be a part of your learning. Hope to see you in the Heat!>
77:<Sorry.  I just found how this works.  There ARE sub-forums. :)>
78:<Thanks, Nashiwa. :)  I couldn't find replies to my post and, therefore, didn't see yours until after I'd posted my apology.

I teach college online and have used a variety of platforms.  This one, however, has been stumping me.  (sigh)>
79:<It's 2:20 P.M., January 16, and 54 degrees with a humidity of 24% in Orlando.  I like this weather!!! :)>
80:<The topic of brown adipose was very interesting to me. I'm curious about the fact that it tends to be found in leaner adults. I wonder if this has to do with genetics. For instance, if a person is genetically inclined to have a faster metabolic rate or to be leaner are they more likely to possess brown adipose than a person who has lost weight and is at the same body mass index as the former individual. Is the theory of making yourself cold via cold showers or running around in the snow a viable one? Or are these people just looking for another way to get out of exercise ;)

I'd rather be warm, sweaty, and strong then cold and well, cold.>
81:<I have always been a small person.  At 40, I weigh 102 lbs and am 5'1".  An avid swimmer as a child, I would end up with purple finger and toe nails after much time in the water and covered in goosebumps even though it was 85' F.  At least I understand why now!

Also, my body responds rapidly to cold by shivering, but mostly by extreme teeth-chattering.  MY grandmother always said it was quite natural and my body was responding the way it should to warm up.  Boy, was she right!  :)>
82:<Hi, I'm from Toronto and especiAlly this year we are no strangers to cold. At one point it went down to -38C on the windshield. Also, having grown up in Sibiria I have experienced cold all the time. Thus, I'm more excited & looking forward to lectures 'bout heat and hot places:)>
83:<Hi all! I am a graduate student from Utrecht University, the Netherlands in the field of Physiology. Decided to take this course for the fun of it and am pretty excited :)>
84:<What's up! I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from beautiful South Africa. 
Im a Stunt Performer. The course was sent to me by my brother as he knew i'd take interest in learning what stresses the body can go through due to my profession.

So far loving it!
Thank you. :)>
85:<Staff: I'm glad it's helping, Lucero.  Speaking of extreme weather, make sure your two golf playing kids keep their clubs down in a lightning storm :)>
86:<Hi! 
My name's <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I'm Spanish but now I'm living in France. 
I found this topic interesting :) 
I'm taking this course for fun, also in order to improve my skills in English and to use some of the knowledge for my new life in this cold region. 
Have a good day and weekend to everybody ^^>
87:<Yeah!! It was one of the most interesting parts that I learned about goosebumps. really amazing strategy of the body!!!! :)>
88:<I see you answered my question to JEarl, AAu.  :)  Thank you!>
89:<My two ideas on your question are (1) you are not truly getting to VO2 max or (2) everyone is a little different and perhaps you can just breath better through your nose.

VO2 max can really only be sustained for a matter of a handful of minutes, and getting there takes a little while.  Even at a VO2 max workload, it can take 2 minutes or so for the lagging response to "catch up" with the demand (meaning your heart rate and breathing take ~30-seconds to respond when you start working really hard).  During your stress test, a pre-determined heart rate is just a safe way for the test operator to get a good idea of the information they are seeking.  You should be reaching your actual maximum heart rate (not the theoretical and often inaccurate 220 minus age).

So your whole evening of dancing is more of an endurance "sub maximal" workload or level of effort (since it's more than a few minutes), and no surprise there that you can breath without breaks or opening your mouth.

If your head is spinning, you get tunnel vision, you have a hard time standing and feel like collapsing, then you know that is a good VO2 max test.  :)>
90:<Thank you very much for useful tips!
With our severe winters I may need them helping myself or others :)>
91:<I hope it works for you, californiasnow! :)>
92:<Thanks. It helped and I will find more Information online. :)>
93:<Staff: 
Marilyn, that is unusual.  What usually stops you during the stress test? Overall, fatigue? I suspect it is not shortness of breath or you would automatically open your mouth to allow in more air.  Perhaps, it is not a max test that you are doing on the treadmill and they are only checking your heart up to a certain speed like 100 bpm.  If it is a true max test, try opening your mouth next time and maybe you will go farther. If not, maybe you just have a very low resistance nose :)>
94:<a fuzzy pair of slippers in addition to the socks is amazing, it is what helps me survive Canadian winters :)>
95:<Glad I could help! :)>
96:<Massive thanks to Anne and Corey for providing an opportunity to learn in such a stimulating fashion. I have rarely been empowered to learn in such a varied approach...certainly taps into learning on multiple levels and aptitudes...something most educational organizations lack. 

I am getting back into 'study mode' after years of brain hibernation ;) which should stand me in good stead for further study and learning. 

Thanks

97:<Hi,

Not sure whether I'm the only one with a poor internet connection, but my internet has been a bit funny lately so it took forever to download the lecture slides (almost 30 MB).  I was wondering if it would be possible to upload alternative lecture slides as PPT/PDF with reduced quality pictures?  I've taken an online course previously, and they offered alternative slides without pictures (or low quality JPEGs), which usually reduced the size to <1 MB.

Thank you :)>
98:<Hi NeillSF,

I think the 25 years of personal experience really helps!  I never did college after high school - and then did an associates degree in my 30's -- now I'm picking things up again in my 50's.  My mother always used to tell me that college is wasted on the young :)>
99:<:) Yes. You're right. Mom has been worrying a bit. Speaking of which, its been a few days, I'm going to give my mom a call...>
100:<And what about hibernation? In the last video Dr Friedlander said that core temperature between 23-25C is usually fatal with some exceptions. And my question is about this exceptions. Is it like this exceptions are some "miracles" that you allmost can't explain it in terms of physiology, or there are some ways leading to state called hibernation? Or is it impossible?

And my second question is about cryotherapy. Sometimes, when you have problems e.g. with your joints, you can try some cryotherapy. Why is it working and isn't it dangerous to your tissues?

Finally, thanks for interesting lectures:)>
101:<Hi everybody.
My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, studying food science and technology. I am very glad to participate this course, because I`ve learned a lot during this week.
Wish you all good luck :)>

103:<I understand this, AnjaliManohar, and thank you for your answer. :)

The thread I'm talking about, though, is giving examples of children's staying warm when their parents can't take the cold any longer.  This seems to be in direct contradiction to, "Kids and adults over 60 have more trouble staying warm.">
104:<When it's below 40F, I wear a wool headband and gloves while running to make sure all the tender bits are comfortably warm once I warm up. Then fewer clothes are needed on the rest of your body.

I love running in the cold because I can go faster at a lower heartrate.  If you plan to run with a small group, it helps motivate you, because you've made a commitment. :-)>
105:<Hello :)
My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am form Croatia. I am a student on Faculty of Kinesiology so I thought this course could be very interesting for me as someone who is fascinated by the human body, and educative for my future in collage and job afterwards.>
106:<Hello! I'm from Russia, and there is —20 centigrade outside now. Good that I need not to go out right now. As a child, I remember that I was really excited when temperatures got below -25 (up to -35, as I remember) centigrade, as it meant that I don't have to go to school — but I was free to do any other winter activities, such as go skiing :)>
107:<Hello! I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I am from Philippines, I graduated BS Biology but I still want to learn using another platform! :)>
108:<Hello Everyone .. Happy New year ..! :) I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from India .. & I'm a civil Engineer.. The reason I choose this course is, basically I'm very fond on topics related to Medicine .. Saying about Physiology, I do have so many experiences on how a human body responds in such extreme conditions.
I have gone through cold in snow fall, heat in desert safari, Altitude in mountain climbing, Pressure in Scuba diving ..
As this course is very related to me, I'hv choose it .. & I'm very excited to learn more about the hidden secrets taking place inside our body during such extreme conditions..

This Course is ![enter image description here][1] I'm enjoying ... :)

109:<Very interesting, MeLoGa! :)  I wonder why it's in these particular regions.>
110:<A really great lecture! Congratulations :)>
111:<Hi, I managed to finish the entire unit on phisiology of heat including exam section and all questions in each module. I was little late to start on phisiology of cold and made up over the weekend. I got bit excited and finished unit 2 in one stretch. 
How soon will the next unit be posted. I'm going through the extra videos and experimental interviews posted. But would be great to know when the next starts.
And thanks to the entire staff team for such an interesting course, I'm really learning a lot.
Kudos to Corey for actually going through with the experiments :) 

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
112:<Hi, my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I am finishing my education degree in Manitoba, Canada,  where we have a windchill of -38C/-36F again today :) My focus is on middle years education (grades 6-9). I have a strong interest in teaching science through storytelling and in finding ways to help adolescents learn about human biology. At that age, most young people are very anxious about human biology, but VERY interested in issues of survival and testing the limits. I suspect that environmental physiology may be a way to get them excited about how their bodies work and what human beings are capable of.>
113:<y'all need to mic each individual person in the experiential interviews, the sound quality is VERY poor.  in the Ken Zemach interview, had to keep rewinding because it was almost unlistenable due to the poor acoustics (echoing) in the room

the quality of the content is top notch, I'm learning a lot about what I see in my own training as well as what I hear from others in conversation/podcasts/etc.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sound quality of Skype with decent microphones, but I don't think it's too hard to setup an interview so you're not recording lots of echo. :)>
114:<I sometimes experience swollen fingers when exercising in the heat, much more when I'm hiking for several hours than when I'm running.  After the discussion on hyponatremia, I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that I drink water more consistently during a hike than I do when I'm running; maybe I am taking in too much water than the exertion level requires?  Our rule of 'thumb' :) on our hikes is 'salt your sausages', meaning that we need to take in more salty food, which also seems to fit with this conclusion.  Once I have stopped hiking, the fingers go back to their normal size within half an hour or so and I am not in any danger of hyponatremia (I don't believe), but it would be nice to find a way to avoid the swelling altogether with my hike diet.  I haven't been able to get the balance right on most of the warmer hikes.

Am I at least on the right track, in keeping salt levels up when I notice the swelling?>
115:<Hello everyone,I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> born and bred in Hungary, living in Spain or elsewhere or traveling. I am a very curious person, since I will be in my body for a while I would like to best use and keep it :) (also doing sports)

(btw this is the best online course I have taken so far! many thanks)

nice to to meet you all :)>
116:<Goosebumps caused when a muscle around a hair follicle contracts by coldness!! ;)>
117:<"assuming my cycling technique didn't change." Is that legit?  Is it not one of the key factors in endurance training?  (I answered the oxygen consumption would be less.  :-)>
118:<Hi...I am south India,which's a hot place so I really don't know much about food for cold environments. For the past few months I am in Delhi which gets cold in winter. I 've been having a lot of paneer( cottage cheese) soups, potatoes, meat. 

I have never gone on hikes so wouldnt be able to advise you on food for hikes. :)>
119:<Hi everybody :)>
120:<Hi Joe! I'm from New England as well and have begun participating in many different kinds of athletic events since I turned 40.  This weekend I am participating in the "Winter Wild Event" at Sunday River in Maine, USA which involves running 4 miles, both up and down the mountain.  I am so glad we started with the cold section because temps this weekend are supposed to be subzero and the race begins at 7am.  I am concerned about how my body will react to the cold, but feel better prepared after completing the first week of lessons.  Good luck to you! I hope you learn all you need to be a successful athlete! :)>
121:<"Too much ice cream cooled my core!!"

You win the award for funniest title!  :)

Three Twins all the way!!>
122:<This week seems easier for me, more familiar with the subject :)>
123:<Hi Erin,

I am also living in NYC and have friends that are preparing for the cycling season. I am excited to learn more about how the body adapts to the surrounding conditions, of course with the crazy adaptions to city dwelling :)>
124:<This is an excellent online course. Well done, and please keep up the fantastic work!

A gentle suggestion: perhaps avoid using the phrase "rule of thumb." I've been told that this is an inappropriate phrase, however innocently used, because of its origin.  In a legal case from 1868, State v. Rhodes, a husband was found innocent because, in the words of the judge, "the defendent had a right to whip his wife with a switch no larger than his thumb."

Regardless of whether this citation is correct, I now avoid this phrase. Perhaps the phase "general take-home rule" could be used instead.  Just an idea!  :)>
125:<Could it be there is more than one correct answer and you have only checked one of them?  ;)>
126:<I'm not an expert but...

Blood pressure is going to more affected by hydration status rather than sodium levels.  As you lose more plasma volume due to sweating, that is one reason why you will have a harder time maintaining cardiac output.  So drink something instead of eating a potato chip.  :)

Since your sweat includes sodium, you need to ingest sodium during longer exercise bouts (around an hour or more).  Since salt does help with the transfer of fluid (water will move to the higher salt content solution, aka osmolality), you should ingest a drink that contains some electrolytes (sodium citrate is a good one, probably better than sodium chloride).  Sport drinks also contain a little bit of carbs/sugars to help keep the energy.  Good tasting ones will also make it easier to drink.  

Avoid artificial colors, high fructose corn syrup, and other artificial ingredients.  Some folks with ragweed allergies can't tolerate stevia (same family) and some folks also can't tolerate Xylitol.>
127:<Carbohydrates are useful in sport drinks if you need the carbohydrates.  :)

Examples might include long endurance efforts of greater than 1 hour, poor fueling prior to your exercise bout, high intensity exercise session with incomplete prior fueling, a high period (multiple days) of exercise sessions where maintaining glycogen stores are important.>
128:<When I lived in Vermont while going to school at UVM, I wore a ski cap in my college apartment while doing homework. It always did the trick :)>
129:<Staff: 

Alexander, Thank you for your suggestions. If we redo the experiment we will consider running it for longer to see what happens to the temperature curves as he recovers. What goes up, must come down... and vice versa :)>
130:<Hi, it's wonderful to see how different we are, yet interested in the same course! My name's Kasia, I'm from Poland and I'm taking this course out of pure interest in humans:)
Enjoy the course!>
131:<not strange is you've ever gone through menopause!! ;)>
132:<Hi all!

I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I live in the Eastern Sierra of California - I love exploring our local mountains (hiking, backpacking, snow hiking, Jeeping, camping). I was a park ranger in Yosemite for 10 years and used to lead 7-day backcountry trips to the High Sierra Camps. I had a WFR but mostly didn't need it for any exposure-related injuries in the "Gentle Wilderness" of the Sierra in summer. Since then I've gotten my nursing license, and I did my clinical training at Mammoth Hospital. Cold injury is common there and they warm all their IV fluids by default. Between teaching and nursing, I can use this course for CEUs and valuable learning about environmental physiology, and I'm so excited to be here!

A funny thing I can share about myself:

I joined class a little late and am just finishing week on on Cold - listening to the expert interview at the end talking about cold shock reminded me - I'm a Polar Bear Club member!! I remember quite well the feeling - I was at Prudhoe Bay (Deadhorse) Alaska, and wanted to swim in the Arctic Ocean - I thought, I'm used to swimming in High Sierra Streams and Lakes, how much colder can it be? 

It was colder. It was also shallow, so I couldn't actually swim, but had to dunk myself to earn my Polar Bear Club membership - oh, and a side note: I almost didn't get to do it because it had been foggy earlier in the morning and there had been an ACTUAL POLAR BEAR in the area and they didn't want us to get eaten - ha! Anyway, when I waded out far enough to realize I had to dunk, I did it and had the full gasping for air, tachycardia cold shock - it was wild! I couldn't get out of the water fast enough - I hurried so much I lost my balance and fell back in. 

The event is memorialized on YouTube... you can see that I am a larger woman with extra body fat for insulation, so imagine how much worse it would have been if that weren't so. Anyway, to show that I have no shame and a sense of humor about myself, I hereby share my video with the class for your entertainment:

[<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> Joins the Polar Bear Club][1]

I'll have you know that on a tour bus full of people (which is the only way you can actually get to the Arctic Ocean in Prudhoe Bay since 9/11), I was only one of TWO people who did this. I'm rather proud of my she-balls. :)

133:<What's up Corey, Anne and the EP101 team! My name is Alex <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I live in Los Angeles, CA. My primary focus is on Computer Science, but I think the human mind and body are incredible things. I'm running in my first marathon this March and thought it would be cool to get some deeper insight into what my body is going through as I run. I'm a strong believer that gaining experiential knowledge is the only way really learn something well. Thanks you all for putting this course together. The videos and questions are a lot of fun. I actually feel things clicking in my mind! :)>
134:<Howdy! My name is Alex. I'm running in my first marathon this March and was wondering if there are any other long distance runners taking this course? I've been running seriously for about two years and now and would love to network.

If there are any veterans here, I'd love to get advice or hear about your running stories!

If you're not a runner, post anyway! It would be cool to connect with others that are just as fascinated about the human body. :)>
135:<Another anastomoses typo in the first heat module - "anastomomoses" - but this time it is wrong on the slide itself, AND the transcription, though the instructor pronounces it correctly. Odd. Anyway, Typos. That's my "con." :)>
136:<Is it true your body gets warmer if you drink cold beverages rather than hot ones?
Please explain! 
Thanks! :)>
137:<Thanks for the quick response :) any developments on this?>
138:<On the other hand, if the Caffeine is by way of a hot Chocolate or hot Coffee being drank to warm up after being out in the cold, wouldn't it help warm the body up?  I know drinking a hot chocolate on a cold day seems to at least temporarily help me to warm up! :-)>
139:<My wife some nights can be quite hot, other nights not so.  Talking body temperature here! :-) It has nothing to do with physical activity or even taking a hot or cold bath, but rather just external body heat. It's like her internal thermostat is off.   Thinking about this, and perhaps this will be discussed in the heat lesson, what causes a "fever" when sick?>
140:<I am by far no expert, but I am an asthmatic who enjoys mountain biking and I am also a yoga instructor. I tell my beginning students to breath in through their nose on most upward movements and out through their mouths on downward...For me a strong exhale through  the mouth helps to get most of the carbon dioxide out, you automatically keep about 20% air reserve in your lungs. For me strong breathing keeps that air moving. I explain it as a cootie thing (germs), that air reserve is just hanging out in there what if that air has someone's sneeze in it :) you want to get that out.Also if I find myself becoming winded I find it easier to control my asthma with long slow inhales through nose and exhale through mouth to keep anxiety about not being able to breath in check. I hope that helps:)>
141:<I suspect general benefit of subjecting body to heat to "sweat it out" is safer done in sauna, banya, or hamam. (No acute load on heart as frequently happens in Bikram/hot yoga). 
As for asana/vinyasa practice in hot room, right, body is more flexible, so it is safer than jumping into a practice without a warm up in a cold room, as frequently done in many yoga studios.
However, problem is that while outwardly practitioners look similar, (1) their bodies are quite different, and (2), there are many ways of doing same asana/vinyasa which may produce completely different results. E.g. in the same asana, you can passively stretch, or isometrically activate muscles, or engage in PNF stretching, etc. Outwardly it will look nearly identical, but results will be different.  And this is only a physical aspect..
YMMV  :-)>
142:<I noticed the low volume also. I just plug in headphones on my laptop or iPad and it raises the volume on it's own right away. Plus it helps that its right in my ears ;) An external speaker also works to amplify sound.>
143:<Hello all!
I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, a Rochester, NY native, Bikram yoga fan, pre-medical student, and massage therapist so I have enduring relationships with cold (i.e. Polar Vortex), hot and stress ;)
This is my second Stanford Open Edx class. I feel so lucky to be here and so far am loving the modules!>
144:<lol.. looks like u have gained your purpose of life now.. ;)>
145:<Hi ! I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> a French student. Really enjoying this course so far :D>
146:<Thanks. It was really a useful information :)>
147:<Thanks. It was very interesting :)>
148:<Steve, guess it works opposite ways.I live in a hot area, I found cold easy ! :)>
149:<When I was a child, and whenever I had fever, my mom had putting wet textile on my forehead and in she had putting my feet in cold water, specially in the midnight.
Now I can understand the reason...
Viva Mommy :)>
150:<He he he... I have got all my answers from all these modules :)
One of my own experiences in this regards is drinking a simple hand made beverage! consists of water+lemon+sugar. It really works in hot summer.>
151:<I enjoy swimming in temperatures down to about 2°C, but probably only for about 10mins. I think it has something to do with pushing yourself to ones limit. Of course you feel fantastic afterwards and there is a great social side to swimming outdoors year round.  I would like to do an Ice Mile at some point :)>
152:<I think the "yellow jacket" is a type of bee, not a wasp, Barry. :)>
153:<I too got frostbitten toes similar to KMichaud87 Dec 2013 during a 0F (-18C) Colorado mountain run. I also had the deep purple big toes, then blistering, and the layers of skin peeled off leaving an raw red toe. I'll refrain from posting pictures :) It took about six weeks for complete skin/scar tissue coverage.

In my case, the contributing factors were unpacked snowy trails, very porous fabric in my lightweight running shoes, and very thin socks. Another runner with the same shoes and socks experienced the same outcome that day. Minimalist runners take note.

Does anyone know if it's coincidence that we all got it worse on the big toes? Less bloodflow, larger surface area/volume ratio?>
154:<When competing in the Hawaii Ironman, the aide stations had buckets of sponges for athletes to use. I found these to be instrumental on both the ride and run because they kept my legs cooler...which after looking at the data from the Nybo Study makes sense. This was in the 1980's....someone was paying attention even back then:)>
155:<Wow, rfd, you competed on Hawaii back in the 80's?
That's my big (hairy) goal for one day.

I've only done one full Ironman distance (pluss 4x half Ironman), but I will get to Hawaii one day ;)

--> When watching the Module 3, I kept thinking back to my experience of the Ironman in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2010, when it was around 36C, and high humidity in the air.
I was on my bike at appr 28km/h, and still having sweat drops on my shoulders that wouldn't go away. But I like competing in the heat, so that was fine.

They say in the video that skin temperature is more important than core temperature for endurance event - I find that really interesting.
On the run, my skin certainly warmed up compared to the bike part (due to reduced speed) - I was using sponges all the time. LOVED them - couldn't have done without them.
I guess the feeling of cooling one's skin on hot endurance evens is also important due to the "feel-good" effect, it kind of stressed me down, enjoying the cold water, maybe that prevented central fatigue, who knows?
At least I kept an even pace throughout the run (in the late afternoon, and it was sunny).
I didn't like to cool my legs though, i didn't want my shoes to get all soaked (kind of hard to avoid though).

What would you think about using leg compression?
That would make sense for hot endurance events, helping the blood back to the core?
They would also cool down the legs when getting wet.
I think I'll buy a pair and test in the summer.

Do you still compete in endurance events, rfd?>
156:<Here is a 3-minute video on this question that gives good summary of relevant research made to date -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=RWiOhlqEDz4
Overall, the question is not that simple - cold temperature indeed cannot cause cold by itself, but nonetheless there are associated factors that could affect likelihood of catching a cold.>
157:<Pouring cool water to the head gives a sudden comfort sensation when exposed to heat. From the lecture, the professor said that face was one good area for cooling down. But maybe immersing our hands wont leave our shirt wet. It just technical :D>
158:<I just gave birth in December. During my pregnancy, I could not get a strait answer on a number of issues all having to do with heat: no hot baths, don't raise your core temp over 150 when exercising, ect. It all makes sense to me now! Thanks MidwifeMichelle :)>
159:<I can definitely relate! I've had similar experiences. I know that when the water is still, your body temp is literally heating the surrounding water. However, with larger bodies of water, I don't think that really applies. I think, if anything, it's a psychology thing. Your mind is just getting used to it.

I remember some Chicago winters that were really bad. No matter how cold it was, I still needed to commute around the city. At a certain point, I think you can just convince yourself that you'll be okay and your body will start to mute certain situations. Have you ever sat still for an extended period of time? It's crazy to experience the kind of sensations that crop up. Every second you're alive there are these tiny little tingles, itches, vibrations, etc. across and in your body. I think the mind just labels them as unessential to your survival and will mute them. The same applies to cold bodies of water, if you stay convinced that you'll be okay, your mind will help you and mute certain sensations. That doesn't mean that your body temp is no longer dropping or that you're truly "warm" in the water, but that you've muted the sensations associated with being in the water.

That's just my opinion. Would love to chat more about it. :)>
160:<Yeah! Always aim for clear urine. Try to drink a lot of water. But don't chug water either. The key to life is balance. Try to have a glass of water every hour that you're awake. It's a good place to start! :)>
161:<It gets a little confusing. Hypothermia: COLD. Hyperthermia: HOT. This trick is not entirely accurate, but it helps to associate hypothermia with the letter "O" which connects to the word "out". Heat loss. Hyperthermia can be associated with the letter "E" which connects to the word "enter". Heat gain.

I hope that helps! :)>
162:<Thank you for your help. Sometimes a good example is what it takes to understand  difficult concepts (for me anyway)!.
(:-)>
163:<Hallo guys,My name is Kiko,from GERMANY,am a neuropsychology student and human biology always makes me feel some type of way ;)>
164:<I must thank you Imke for making me know about compression gear and for those new like me i wish you would love this article too :)
http://runnersconnect.net/running-tips/the-science-of-compression-gear-for-runners/>
165:<i guess being in a hospital is different, for us the hospital is always cold and my patients complain from my cold hands :) i'm an ER intern so we have other ways of cooling off our patients but i was surprised when making him walk around didn't decrease his temp i guess he was a special case>
166:<Although all of the modules are very interesting and educational, module about risks, consequences, and practical tips is (again) the most interesting part of the lesson :) 

Great job guys :)>
167:<Hello, people! My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am from Russia. It's -26 C (-14,8 F) outside right now, so physiology of cold becomes more and more practical for me :-) Many thanx to the course team! It's a pleasure to learn this great topic with help of these great people! Good Luck everyone!>
168:<... so far, attitude appears to be a conspicuous driver of aging well.  Interesting!  (makes me want to change my own! :-) )>
169:<I can relate to the problem :) Maybe it is connected to wrong posture? Just a guess. But I believe many people have this problem, otherwise there would not be invented a feet heater, which can be connected to computer via USB :)>
170:<Staff: 
Nice catch, Hackwrth.  When you get to Module 9, you will see that I mention in passing that the most recent study on Monkeys causes some confusion on whether CR will work in primates and humans, but I was less explicit in the introduction (and will likely need to re-record that at some point). The more recent NIA study is cleaner (in that there weren't some questionable data exclusions like the earlier study).  The mechanisms of CR are still fascinating though.  Also, why would it work in essentially all other species except primates and above?  Intriguing, yes? It will be very interesting to see what comes next.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue enjoying 100% of my calories :)>
171:<... the extra footage is worth the 8 minute time investment.  It solidifies all of the other practical and physiological advice - and will probably keep me healthier for the time investment (which I made standing up :-) ).>
172:<Also, the fire is constant. Although it may be the same fire scene repeated for all the check-ins, during each 3 minute segment of time the fire continues to change. :)>
173:<Hi, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Singapore, just started the course two days ago. I run long distance (half and full marathons), and do all kinds of sports (ski, swim, cycle...). Taking the course for fun, to learn more about our amazing bodies, and because it is so very relevant! :)>
174:<Thanks a lot for this module. It gave me inspiration and motivation to change my lifestyle and increase physical activity asap. I'm still in my 20's but now I see that it's better to start sooner than later. 
Can't wait to see next module :)>
175:<My husband and one of my friends is like this.  I travel with my own, portable furnace. :)>
176:<let us know :)>
177:<**Team EP101** - thank you so much for your dedication and passion that you convey through your videos and your work to all of us!

**Corey**, have fun, take care and tell your mom that her son is a Superhero of thousands of people right now ))) ;)

**Anne**, you have an amazing smile! ) This is so inspiring to see you smiling while teaching us! 
And when in Module 3 of Physiology of Aging you moved from one side of the slide to another with your comments, I was laughing during a minute! )))

**Thank you so much, guys!**

It is getting more interesting with every video!

Keep going!>
178:<On mini break between videos supporting muscles and aging and could not help but think that this lecture goes a long way in proving that a 50+ Rocky could take on a much younger challenger and shown in the clip attached...  :)

179:<I haven't exercised much lately. I didn't have much time when I started University. But after watching this week's lectures I'm starting again, haha. I'm walking for 30 minutes every morning with my dog and in the afternoon I'm dancing with my sister for an hour or so. It feels great! :D>

181:<Having a bad rotator cuff damaged from repeated separations of the shoulder, my routine has been with band work.  In fact its what got me back in the pool and back into open water swimming this past year.  Unfortunately, it did not help me beat my swimmer daughter in the Chesapeake Bay 4.4mile swim tho...  Best of luck.  :)>
182:<hi anishatyagi. great explanation. but i do have one question though...shivering is the only time when both agonist and antagonistic muscles are contracted? thanks. :)>
183:<I dance up a storm! :)  I'm 68 years old and people who don't know it think I'm in my early 40's.  As a matter of fact, I've danced very fast rings around people in their 20's.>
184:<I've had multiple surgeries on both rotator cuffs, Motivated1; and two of my tendons in each arm are basically gone.  My goal is to be able to lift my arms over my head without hurting my neck and hip as these muscles are the ones which allow me to lift my right arm; I can't lift my left one without the help of the right.  It would be nice to be able to lift something that weighs, too. :)

I expect to have to have both shoulders replaced because of pain and that will mean starting the physical therapy again.

Dumbbells, unless I use them on my back, aren't an option as I kill my neck muscles in any other position.

I'm a dancer; this doesn't help my rotator cuff problem.  As a matter of fact, it causes pain when I lift my right arm in improvisational dance.

I suppose I'm not motivated *enough*.  (sigh)>
185:<Thanks for the response.  I've taught exercise and enviro phys at the U of AZ and Marquette and have been interested in how you cover what you cover.  How I've covered this particular topic has changed more recently.  I think a group like NUSI will really help shed light on this.  They are now directing over $40 million in funds toward research that is best designed to answer questions about diet and metabolism.  The TED Talk hints at the speaker's personal experiments, but I'll link below a separate talk he gave about his experience with among others things metabolic chambers, detailed blood work, and a ketogenic diet (I don't follow one, and the speaker states emphatically that he doesn't know who should either).  And while n=1 experiments aren't definitive, they can be illuminating (just like Corey's :)

186:<Hi!

It would be interesting to know how Corey's opinion about aging changed after his experience in the "Agnes suit" and all the information we've learned from the section. 

And also - Did he change his habits or something in life in order to be our healthiest Superhero as he ages? :)

Please, share with us your outcomes and results, Corey!

187:<Staff: 
Sasha, It depends on what mix of fuels you are using to power you along. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein gives you about 4 kcals and each gram of fat gives you about 9 kcals.  However, when you use a gram of glycogen you also lose about 3 grams of water with it because of the way it is stored.  If you were running at a moderate pace and thus were using 50% CHO and 50% fat (in terms of kcal, not grams).  You would lose 5.5 gm of fat, 12.5 gm of CHO and 37.5 gm of associated water. Total = 55.5 gm.  You'd better check my math though :)>
188:<Hello! I am enjoying this course very much, it is very interesting.The advice from this section will come in handy:) 
My question is, let's say you are on a boat, you have an accident, and you fall in the water and get all wet. It was said that in water you get colder faster, but what is safer? To, let's say, climb on the part of the boat that is still floating, being all wet and with the air temperature lower than the water temperature, or staying in water?

P.S.:, I find it a little annoying that the volume of the videos is low... I listen to it directly through my laptop speakers and I have to max it up to hear properly. Maybe you could do something about that?>
189:<HI! I got a little confused my the following, would appreciate an insight.
So we are saying that caloric restriction is good for health but then it also brings the metabolic down, right? Isn't it bad? Wasn't it said that high metabolic rate is great, keeps us warm (older people get cold faster b/c of a slower metabolic rate), etc.? Thanks:):):)>
190:<Hi! There's a lot said about what we should eat before and after a workout. It used to be my understanding that we need to eat carbs before (for fuel) and protein after for muscle-building, to make use of the workout effectively. Makes sense. But then recently I started seeing these articles that within 20-40 mins after the workout some "carbohydrate window" opens and we should in fact eat carbs (to "fight" cortisol which keeps working and damaging the muscle tissue). Is that right?

p.s. befriending a jar of peanut butter in case this is true:))>

192:<Maybe you are just endowed with good genes, and would have done well with other activities? Or maybe your active lifestyle keeps you well? ;-)
Maybe those new students are amazed because they are not fit? :-)

Coincidentally, my "only" physical activity is yoga too.
But I would be more impressed to hear e.g. how yoga helped to recover from chronic condition. I am yet to see a convincing story, besides promises of eventual siddhis. But suppose it does. :-) As years pass, I am less and less sure what many people mean by "yoga", although there is seem to be no shortage of people who treating it as a religion.

If we are talking about yoga taught in the typical studio, sure, it has plenty of strong sides, and can build core strength alright. But by no means it is do-it-all, it has plenty of weak sides as well: it does not work on spontaneous reaction, dynamic stretch, or dynamic balance, not as plyometric as some matrial arts, or parkour, it is heavily scripted and staged (i.e. not much spontaneity), it can be hard on body, much less fluid than dance, or focused on energy comparing Qi-gong or Tai-chi, etc., etc. - even if you lucky enough to find a good teacher. Yes, some of these can be addressed - but "default" version is not conductive to these.>
193:<I have lived in the high desert of Eastern Washington most of my life.  It gets quite hot here in the summer 90-110 degrees or more at times.  Very low humidity.  I have always had a high tolerance to heat, however, as I age I have found that to be changing as well.  I am 49 and menopausal (TMI? haha).  

I started running for exercise last spring.  Through the summer months I would have to run very early because I couldn't tolerate the heat.  As the weather began to cool I noticed that my performance improved tremendously.  It was eye opening when I learned the reason why.  My pace is a full minute and a half per mile quicker than it was in the summer.  This may be partly related to my improved fitness...however, I can attest to the fact that running in the cold (20 to 40 degrees) makes me feel much more invigorated and my endurance is very high.   I'm training for a half marathon - I'll have to find one to run in the fall I guess ;)>
194:<Even though I'm still in my twenties, this information was really helpful for me! I teach exercise and stretching classes for older adults, so it is great to understand more about why some 82 year olds are stronger and more balanced than other exercisers who are 15 years younger. I will share this information with my clients, especially the  fact that exercise can slow cognitive decline. Thanks for a great presentation of the different processes of aging as well as so many great practical tips on how to use this information in real life. Can't wait for the Stress module, since that's something I'm experiencing in my life already! :)>
195:<dfanders, 
Fantastic question!  Unfortunately, there is no answer at the moment.  Many researchers are working very hard to figure it out though... especially as many of them approach that magic age of 70 :)

In the meantime, take a moment to watch the expert interview with Tom Rando at the end of this section.  Although he doesn't answer your specific question, he does give some interesting insights on the process of aging.>
196:<Hi Corey, I just wanted to congratulate you for your class! Nice job!!! Were you stressed?;)>
197:<I have been to many similar lectures lately, honestly your lectures are delivered in an easy and attractive way :)

Thanks>
198:<I'd second the congratulations to yourself and Anne (and the rest of the team) on what has been a very informative and interesting series of 'lectures'!  As an educator of primary and secondary students, the information provided by this course will be extremely useful for me as it provides an excellent balance of breadth and depth, making me want to learn more and pass it on to my students..

Whilst the exams have varied somewhat in their difficulty (I felt there was a lot of repetition in the last exam from the 'check your understanding' sections) they have reinforced the lecture content and have helped to maintain enthusiasm and confidence.

Looking forward to the altitude lectures :-)

Keep up the good work!>
199:<MrSuperb, 
Interesting idea.  I'm sure that Corey will want to weigh in here, but I thought I would drop in my 2 cents as well. You may very well be right.  However, because they were living on average 40 years less than today, the chronic stress probably didn't have time to manifest itself into many of the chronic diseases we see today.  Also, if they were that stressed out, it was likely partially balanced by a physically active lifestyle and fewer donuts :)
In today's long-lived, stressful society, stress management tools become more important for a healthy lifespan than back in the paleolithic period when you were much more likely to be killed by something or someone else than by chronic diseases.>
200:<I just finished watching the Module 6 - Exercise and Brain video, and I was so happy to hear at the end exactly what I was feeling these days, so just wanted to comment on that.

I'm talking about the Good Side of Aging Brain... I'm over 40, non-English native speaker but started active lifestyle at age 36 (before that, off and on some weight training, but I always got bored with it. I found Jazzercise and became instructor in the US. At first it was quite a bit of challenge since Jazzercise instructors give a lot of verbal cues and safety precautions and stories through mic...that was another brain exercise, too, by the way), so I have been definitely appreciating positive effects of physical exercise.

This year I found this course and other online courses, and this was one of the perfect courses to enhance my knowledge and understanding as a fitness instructor. Although I haven't taken any physiology classes or have done extensive studying on the subjects, there are so many things I can relate to so well, I can understand lectures very well, and also I'm motivating myself based on my experiences and questions in my mind based on those experiences, better than if I were younger.

This eye-opening thought just occurred last week actually. That also gave me the sense of "happiness" of being where I am today...not disliking the aging, but actually embracing it and appreciating it!!! It was such a nice coincidence for me that Dr. Friedlander mentioned that in the lecture, so I shouted "YES!" in front of the computer...ha ha!

I'm so glad to be able to take this course. Dr. Friedlander, Corey and all the EP101 staff have done such a wonderful job to make the learning so much fun and easy to relate!!! 

I also have to add that I'm so glad that I found active lifestyle in my latter 30s. Probably earlier the better, but now I know both sides of the experiences: the side of me who didn't like physical activity, unfit and disliking myself (depression?) vs. the other side of me who loves physical activity, relatively fit and confident of myself...and as a bonus, I have a lot of friends from Jazzercise! Thank you for covering all these benefits!!! You made my day :)>
201:<First of all: this section on stress looks like it'll be fantastic!
I really appreciate the premises to this section of Corey's introductory video. 

Now it's time for my doubt: the autonomic nervous system's model that's proposed here is the most diffuse scale-like model: one arm goes up and the other goes down depending on the external situation. By the way, I see the emotional sphere as an external situation, because it can influence our reaction not differently than a real lion does (yes, it's your boss I'm talking about :) ).

Anyway...I've doubts that the scale-like model is accurate enough to describe what the autonomic system (AS) functioning actually is.The scale-like model is good enough to describe a full-fledge activation, but not good enough to take into account what happens in  low level, chronic stress.

My doubt arose when I studied that in every situation where the sympathetic innervation is damaged, the skin becomes thin, hypotropic, it looses its hairs, the muscles are thinner and react slowly,  and the same hypotropism take place in visceral organs. Therefore a sympathetic tone is essential even in tropotrophic situations and this is not correctly described in the scale-model.
To keep it short, I can't understand the nature of the relationship between the sympathetic (SS) and the parasympathetic system (PS) in low stress situations. 
Is the SS controlled by PS in low stress situations but not in high stress situations? 
Is the PS controlled by SS, instead?
Is only the low SS activation level permissive to the counterbalancing effect of the PS?
I can't really figure out what a more precise model could be because it's extremely hard to find new physiology studies about this.
Any suggestion is really appreciated.
Thanks for reading.>
202:<Hi Corey! I just wanted to say you're doing an awesome job with the lectures :-)>
203:<I just came across this study that was done by some college students who came down to Huntsville, Texas last February for the Rocky Raccoon 50 and 100 mile race.  

http://drbreenbiomech.blogspot.com/2014/01/rockyraccoonresearchresults.html

This race consists of either five 20 mile loops for the 100 mile race or three 16.6 mile loops for the 50 miler.    The entire race is on a rooty trail, with very little spectator support.  

The bottom line is, you just don't get much cheering for most ultramarathons, so seeing enthusiastic people cheering after you've bee out there for 12 - 30 hours is a real treat.  I could see that the results may be a bit skewed as a result.  These kids were quite the cheering section and I looked forward to seeing them every loop.  I know that when I saw them I tended to speed up a bit, to look good for the camera of course!  (I kid!   Seriously, there's no way to look good during a trail race unless you're  Anton Krupicka.)




Still, I think their conclusion is spot on: pacing and specifically, starting off slower is a better strategy than the "fly and die" strategy I often see in races.  

I'm sticking with my "start off slow and taper from there" strategy during my 100 mile attempt next weekend.  :-)>
204:<I just wanted to say you're doing an awesome job with this interesting lecture. It was wanderfull waching Dr.Anne jumping from that plane. Congratulations! Corey, I reaaly enjoed your lecture. Yuo are a really good professor. I'm doing my master these on stress, but it is for the good one, eustress :).>
205:<Thank you for this great lecture, I learned a lot of useful things!:)))>
206:<In another thread attached to some module (I can't figure out which one because these notations seem somehow to have disappeared in two browsers) :( Corey said, *"If you find yourself breathing heavily (even if its not for very long!), you are likely dipping in to nonoxidative metabolism aka "going anaerobic".* "

I never breathe heavily.  Whenever I take a treadmill test, they stop it at 9 or 10 minutes because, if they didn't, I'd continue forever (well, that's a long time....).  :)  Anyway, I don't mouth breathe; I carry on conversations with the test's monitors, etc.  This past Saturday night I did fast Latin dancing for 4.5 hours straight, sitting down only for the ten minute break when the music stopped.  I don't know what deep breathing is unless I force it.

So, does this mean I never dip into my nonoxidative metabilism; or do I do so even though I don't breathe heavily?  Thanks!>
207:<Interesting research done with cats. Truly amazing surgical techniques! Did his research correspond with endocrine changes as well? I know there was a question posted about low levels of chronic stress that only addressed the nervous component. Endocrine involvement plays a huge role there (looking forward to that module). I have done research on adrenal function and have seen first hand the detrimental effects on an animal when the adrenal glands are removed (both cortical and medullary). Oh, and by the way, question 4.2 really should have two (2) correct answers! I wouldn't want to be a cat in dear old Walter's Lab :)>
208:<Thank you Corey for all this tips, I feel really beter now! :)>
209:<@YogaPotential, yeah right!! you took the words right outta ma mouth.:)
i really liked this particular video, it was very humorous and educative.

Attaboy Corey!!>
210:<...the chest of that hopeful girl who's crush turns to ask her a question in the middle of class.....

 Almost sounds like Corey has had personal experience doesnt it? :)(with the roles reversed that is)*winks.

Anyhue, these videos are very practical, apart from the exhaled carbon dioxide, we also sweat alot in the process....its quite easy to relate to the physiology of stress coz everyone has felt it first hand...

Thanks again.....>
211:<I love this class! I keep teaching my family, friends, and clients (I'm a massage therapist) about the cool things I learned after the cold, heat and aging modules; they may be getting tired of me.... So, thanks Anne and Corey!

This module is great because it introduces such a useful concept: our stress response and its subsequent effects on our health can be mediated by our mind. As a professional oxytocin vs. stress expert getting into the medical field (pre-med student), it's really inspiring and heartening ( I can feel my oxytocin levels rising just thinking about it:) ) to see the "real" science world and western medicine embracing this subject--especially at places like Harvard (great interview with Dr. Benson) and Stanford!

I hope everyone benefits from some stress-reducing practices this week or has fun using stress in a focused way ;-) ...

Thanks again Anne and Corey!>
212:<Snow storm in New York? Pshhhh, after these lectures I'm gym/sport/pool-unstoppable :) Thank you for your great motivation!!!>
213:<Hi! I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm originally from Russia, now living in New York. I'm into an adventures and travelling. Our next big ambition is a trip around South America for a half a year or so. We want to conquer both snowy peaks of the Andes, as well as Amazonian jungle:) Gotta learn and condition and get excited!
Our bodies are amazing and so capable! Yes we can:):):)>
214:<you most likely feel hotter once you stop swimming due to the lower rate of convection. as you swim water is constantly bringing heat away from your body and flushing new cooler water across your skin. when you stop moving the only convection is due to temperature difference, and if you stand up exposing more of your body to air, the convection between skin and air is much lower than water and skin due to airs low conductivity (it is not at all dense and thus transfers heat poorly).

I have often felt the same way :)>
215:<Yes, absolutely agree with you! Video was great! And have a lot of action and cool music background! =)>
216:<This course is really very informative and I appreciate the time and effort Dr Friedlander, Corey, and the EP101 team have put in to help us understand human physiology. You people are doing such a wonderful job. Thank you :)

Regarding the stress module, I am really curious to know about the effects stress could have on our eating behavior.I have noticed people eat a lot when they are stressed. Is the obesity related to stress just a result of malabsorption disorders or are there any other factors at play too? How does stress contribute to eating disorder at the physiological level?

Just a thought - I get that when you are chased by a lion, its probably not a good time to digest food, but after you have successfully escaped to a lion-free zone by some stroke of luck, aren't the digestive organs supposed to resume their normal functions. If so, then how is a small pause(hopefully :) ) in the digestive process supposed to lead to any disorder?

Any insight will be helpful. Thanks.>
217:<I was shocked to see that Anne will not be our tutor for this unit! i mean Corey is doing a good job but his voice is low and a bit monotonous which needs a little boost and a sprinkle of sense of humor and he'll be great. and Anne, love the skydiving hair!please come back next week, we really miss you!

p.s. i want to suggest adding the written script in a downloadable folder to help us review the data we've learned. Great job to the whole team :)>
218:<I just finished the module on aging and finally noticed what is changing and yet staying the same: the picture of Da Vinci's vitruvian man!  I'm so slow to notice this!  It must be that I was so focused on the scintillating discussion that I didn't notice the background picture.  Or realizing that as I'm aging I must be getting less observant ...  I'd better amp up my daily exercise to combat this obvious decline in my cognitive abilities!  :)>
219:<I'm from Estonia (Northern Europe), and we traditionally have dry saunas, where we have stones on the sauna stove and we throw water on it, which makes it more wet. The steam saunas around here are not as hot in temperature, as the traditional (dry) saunas are. To the dry sauna we may go when there is around 100 degrees C in the sauna, whereas in the steam sauna there might be around 50-70 degrees, easily. When one throws water on the stones in the dry sauna, even though the water cools the sauna and thus brings the temperature down (if you keep throwing the water over and over the stove becomes cooler, unless you keep heating it) - the hot steam that feels as if way hotter to the skin than the dry air. I also sometimes cover my face when the water is thrown.
On the other hand, when going to a 100 C sauna the seats are very hot. Of course it might be that in a SPA people will sit on towels or something anyway :D But in this case it is really useful to sit on a towel, or even when one makes the skin wet in before hand - the seat doesn't feel as hot. I think the water layer starts heating up bit by bit and one doesn't feel the heat then as strongly and sharply as it is felt when sitting on the hot seat with dry skin.>
220:<What?! What about good ol' middle-aged Dr. F? Not cute? :)

Just kidding.>
221:<Very enlightening video and very well explained. Being a very anxious person, all this makes a lot sense for me... also i already did skydive, and as teacher, i am used to talk  in public with some stressful audience... teens ... :) ... just to say that all make sense to me and i understand much better now...
The flood was also very enlightning for me, i would like to understand if there are people more sensitive and reacted to this "phenomenon", i suppose yes, some people seems dont react at nothing... and i dont believe that is just because of some "brain/psychologic" control... i believe it have to do also with physiology....
Thx,

222:<I ballroom dance with 50 or 60 people in their 80's and 90's -- along with younger ones.  We all look at least 20 years younger than we are and become shocked when we find out how old one of us is.  For instance, as far as anyone is concerned until I correct him/her, I'm in my early 40's; I'm actually 68.  As a matter of fact, one of the women is 104 and still dances in spiked heals!!!!!  What a shocker that was when we found out!!!!!

I don't know which is the cause and which is the effect -- dancers maintain youth or those who maintain youth flock to these dances. :)>
223:<Even just watching the lecture video and hearing about the many ways our bodies respond to stress got my heart beating a little bit faster. I know about the stress response all too well. I suffer from depression and anxiety (controlled with medication) but I still get overwhelmed/stressed out/anxious on a daily basis. The meds help to keep me from completely flying off the handle but I can easily go into "fight or flight" mode even when it's a relatively small event. 

One thing that I've been working on controlling better is my stress response to being late. I call my reaction to that stressor, "Punctual Polly". She lives inside of me, I don't like her taking over, and I use self talk to calm HER down, which in turn calms me down. Even if I'm on time going somewhere I start to worry. Then I create scenes in my head where I'm getting in trouble for being even just a minute late. This feeling escalates, I get more anxious, and suddenly the cars in front of me are "purposely" being driven poorly, as though the universe is against me being on time... 

Absolutely silly, I know...that's what I keep telling Polly, too. :)>
224:<Thanks :)>
225:<:), yeah you are, but well, Corey......that relaxation technique, i'v heard it lots of time before,.....just never had their voice stuck in my head.

226:<Hello all!  My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I live in Bend, OR, and I'm a professional wilderness guide and professional motivational speaker.  My personal passion is climbing and I have a penchant for really cold and really high mountains.  :-)  I'm totally fascinated by the human body's ability to adapt and am really excited about all that I have already learned so far, and all that is coming to help me better understand the scientific, physiological explanations for things that I have personally experienced, as well as to help me be a better guide to others.  
Thanks so much, Anne and Corey, for all the work you have put into this course.  I really appreciate the detail and progression, as well as the humor and storytelling aspect!>
227:<That was so cool that you all were able to compare Anne's heartrate from the jump with that of her speech! Totally blew my mind that the pattern was so similar!

I used to be deathly afraid of public speaking, but after a decade of working with Toastmasters and finding a topic about which I'm so passionate, I'm no longer afraid of speaking and sharing my message on stage even with audiences over 500 people - instead of just surviving, my goal is actually to knock their socks off! I had almost forgotten what it was like to have that physiological flooding sensation, aka stage fright, until a few days ago...

I was at a conference just two days ago in my capacity as a new Board member for a Foundation, and I stood up to make a comment and ask a question to a group of 30-40 people. Before I knew it, my voice was quivering audibly and my hands were shaking. I was really pissed off at myself for getting so worked up over just a few sentences! I thought silently, "Any of the people in this room would roll their eyes if they found out I'm a public speaker...better keep that to myself now!"

That very night I saw this module about Anne's heart rate and I was like, "Oh my Buddha! That's EXACTLY what happened to me!" Physically, I felt like I could have been jumping out of a plane.

It seemed that because I was in a new environment, with new peers who I did not know well, and I was making a somewhat controversial observation about a topic with which I was not very familiar, my stress response was activated in a BIG way.

It was so helpful to have the explanation about why that happened and I also now have some tools to be more effective in those situations (I'll try freeze frame next time). :-)>
228:<I'm taking medication for bone density, Cantfindanunusedid.  I've gone from moderate osteopaenia to osteoporosis to almost non-existent osteopaenia.  Maybe it's gone. :)  It would be nice to know, but Medicare would rather pay for the really lousy medication than for the test to find out if it's still necessary.  (sigh)  I think I'll be eligible in another year.>
229:<Thanks, Corey. :)  I've been using meditation and hypnosis since 1978 and use both styles mentioned to get myself into them.>
230:<I definitely agree!! Corey is a great teacher, he speaks really understandable and present the material in interesting way. Also, he doesn't talk fast so it is easy to hear every word loud and clear, and to remember everything. :)>
231:<Disclaimer- I have only watched the first lecture video (Module 2), so this may be discussed in later videos.

During traumatic stressful situations, freezing is another natural response to stress. For example, someone who is in imminent danger may respond to an attacker by freezing, instead of fighting the attacker or fleeing the scene.  In this response, a victim's body is in a state of paralysis, where the victim physically can't move.  Most courses teach flight or fight, causing many victims to feel guilty about freezing during an attack.  However, freezing during traumatic stressful situations is more common that fighting or fleeing.  For example, 88% of people who are raped, report freezing during an attack.  One reason that the body is freezes is because victim's mind can't comprehend what is happening- the body is almost denying what is happening and thinks "this isn't happening to me."  Freezing during an attack is potentially more beneficial than fighting or fleeing because an attacker could fight back harder or chase after the victim. 

Here is a website that states general responses during fight, flight, and freeze: http://trauma-recovery.ca/impact-effects-of-trauma/fight-flight-freeze-responses/

Another interesting topic about stress is post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  I was diagnosed with PTSD last summer, and it has fascinated me how much the mind and the body are connected- this is actually the reason I decided to take this course :) Any documentary or any articles you read on PTSD will state that certain words, sights, smells, etc. can cause a person to experience a flashback or have a panic attack.  When a person has experienced severe trauma, a structure in the back of a persons brain, called the amydgala, is on a high alert and works "overtime."  In a normal person's brain, the amydgala tells someone not to step out in front of a car, or put their hand on a stove, etc.  However, when a person's amydgala is on high alert, daily activities may seem impossible because of the perceived threat.  Always being on high alert also causes a person to always feel tired, yet it does not allow the person to sleep, because of the fear something could happen while sleeping.

I also find it fascinating that a person's body may remember certain muscle positions that the brain doesn't necessarily remember- or at least doesn't put a memory with the muscle position.  For example, I was in a yoga class one day this summer and after switching to one >
232:<It certainly is counter-intuitive to rip the mask/regulator or O2 mask off! I have observed that when people panic their respiratory rate and depth increases and they are unable to get adequate air. They become claustrophobic and start to pull stuff off their face.

233:<From my experience,the significant circulatory problems associated with both CV disease and diabetes are pervasive- a brain that does not get adequate blood supply(cerebral 'perfusion')will have cognitive impairment (learning/memory, concentration issues, etc.) I'm not sure if that helps answer the question :)>

240:<Hi Marilyn!

I appreciate your sharing your story with us, and I'm sorry to hear that your husband passed away.

I am impressed about how well you manage to cope with that situation over so long time (14years!!). You seem like a very kind, strong, well-balanced and caring person!

As for your questions, they are really interesting!

>  A. So, why didn't I feel stress while taking care of him and while dealing with that mugger? The latter situation was as though I'd been a martial arts expert -- which I'm not.


I guess that's what they were talking about in one of the expert interviews, I guess it was the one with Rollin McCraty, it's your emotions in a specific situation that somehow decided whether you are experiencing positive or negative stress, or even no stress at all.
I'd say that you were having a peaceful attitude about the situation you were in? 
While in case with the mugger, of course you would think about that in a different way, I mean that made no sense at all,
while taking care of your husband was an act of love, and love is an active though/attitude, and a good one.

> B. Why did I get sick when I was "allowed" to get sick (I didn't have the responsibility and was able to relax)?

--> I think you just answered your own question. I'm convinced about the strong power of your minds influencing our body, so I'd say all those years you told yourself (unconsciously?) that you had to stay healthy to take care of your husband.
Also, as in exercise, I'd say moderate amounts of stress rather improve the immune system also long-term speaking, so when you de-stressed completely, your body slowed down and your immune system did so too, as there was no need to be aware of an "attack". But I'd say it's more of your mind boosting your immune system.
Interesting, I hope you get further answers to that questions here!

Did you continue to use self-hypnosis and meditation throughout your vacations? If  not, that could contribute to becoming sick. 
It seems anyway that self-hypnosis and meditation helped you to lower your stress levels in a way that prevented it from developing into "chronic stress".
So to say, you were in a stressful situation for many years, but coped with it without an extreme stress response.

Just some thoughts from me :)>
241:<Hi Sali!

I've been having terrible anxiety about going to the dentist.
I went in 2002, and then I stopped for 10 years, simply because I was haveing anxiety attacks just picking up the phone to order an appointment.

Last year I got a hole in one of my teeth, and things were getting stuck in it, so I HAD to go.
I had an anxiety attack while getting an appointment (I went into their office since I wasn't able to cry and speak at the same time :P). Embarrassing? Well, I just couldn't help it.
First session at the dentist: I was having an anxiety attack when taking X-rays! (stupid, this is not painful at all!!!), trembling, crying, and all that.
Well well.
But I was eager to get through it, so I had prepared myself for that appointment:

- I had told everybody around me that I was afraid of going to the dentist, and that I was about to have an appointment. I got so much encouragement, and that kind of stuck to me (I also tried to remember my friends' supportive word, that were calming).
- I had made myself a promise to get my a reward afterwards. Something great, something good!!! So I was not looking forward to the treatment, but to the reward afterwards!
- I also took something soothing with me (a scarf I had bought on vacation, reminding me of good times - that helped a little bit, but mostly due to the soothing effect of holding something soft instead of hanging on to the dental chair, getting my knuckles white).
- I was thinking about music, but thought that I rather have my dentist explaining me what he was doing, since lot of my anxiety was based on early childhood experiences at the dentists, that ended with crying and pain and my parents getting frustratet, and me feeling like I was forced to something so painful without getting comforted, that was a bit traumatic - so - I needed the control about the dentist.
--> now what worked best for me:
I was visualizing something completely different in my head while I got the filling. I visualized myself on a beach, trying to feel the warm sand, hearing the sounds of the waves, seeing the blue sky, the palm trees... at the same time the noise and vibrations of the drill were so strong, I imagined being at that very beach making jewelry pendants out of shells by using a dentist tool-like drill :D :D :D

--> this may sound crazy, but it worked for me. I was thinking, well this is uncomfortable, but I'll finish this jewelry, and it is going to be pretty :D

---> well, just some of my (sorry, quite loooooong) th>
242:<I have two points with this post:

- Telling about my own personal experience with emotion (dis)regulation and stress
- the question whether regular physical exercise can prevent chronic stress (it might have done that for me)
===> is psychological and physiological stress that different, so that you can even can stress down from psychological stress by exercising with a positive attitude)


I was very pleased to hear about the mentioning of the relationship between emotions and stress.
Of course, who would not believe that a positive emotion would help in a stressful situation? 

I'm referring to the interview with Rollin McCraty, where he's pointing out that in the future, the role of emotions will play an even more important role in copying with (psychological) stress.
I am so glad that he also mentions that regulation of emotions is in our own hands, although some people have never been taught to regulate their emotions (!).

I'm just one those people, which is really frustrating. My responses to certain stressful situations are really strong (like unappropriately strong), and my emotions usually last very long (even hours).

Researchers found out that you can even see the difference in the brain of people that lack a good emotion regulation system in brain scans (they seem to have a decreased volume in the amygdala and hippocampus), and there are both genetic and psychosocial reasons for that (there is a short article from psych.central about that [here][1]).

That would explain why I have been suffering from **chronic stress** for the last years. When I tried to start working after my MS degree in 2009, it didn't work out at all, I got all overstressed, couldn't hardly eat nor sleep, stomach pains and headaches constantly, irritable all the time, couldn't really remember people I had met the day before (it took me several months to learn the names of the three kids of a friend of mine, how uncool is that???), and many more symptoms of chronic stress.
I'm being at home now, for a few years which works fine for me :) :)

And lucky for me, I'm doing lots of **exercise**, I've been training for triathlons for many years now, and I guess that is what keeps me from experiencing the really bad side-effects from chronic stress (like impaired immune system). 

--> Or do does all the physical training event prevent the development of chronic stress in the first place?

I just wanted to point out that emotions are *really* important for copying with stress, and>
243:<That is a really interesting question! 

I don't have a solution to that, other than it has been chosen that regular exercise that gets your heart rate really high (high intensity training) has been shown to make the body more stress-resilient.

There is a study on "Stress Reactivity in Fire Fighters: An Exercise Intervention", where fire fighters that had followed a 16 week-exercise program showed lower heart rates and blood pressure and lower anxiety and negative mood reactions. You can find the article by googling the title :)

I'll ask two ambulance drivers I know about what they do to not over-react and keep their stress response down (one of those guys is so relaxed I cannot imagine him getting stressed at all - he's like a rock).
But that's not until tuesday when I'm having First-Aid training!

I hope you get enough undisturbed sleep until then!>

More exercising, less fooding and drinking. But as a French student of this course, I'm a bit reassured after your part about French paradox.

250:<Performance anxiety is real, for sure. If you examined performers' phyz responses, however, I think you'd find a very large difference between a performer going on stage with a new act, vs. a performer going on stage for the 4th or the 20th or the 168th performance of "Cats" (or whatever). Take the exact same math test 5 times, or take five math tests on five different math topics, and you'll see a totally different set of phyz responses [at least you will in me! :-) ].

Yes, people do muddle through, as I've argued. As to whether placebos are effective, there is no doubt they are (although the mechanism still isn't clear, and the issue of how a "placebo" can be a "inert" if it produces an ameliorative effect is tough to get a handle on). One of the great problems I have with this line of argument, however, is that there is a thin line between offering someone a placebo and being a charlatan.>

Also according to a recent study http://www.sciencenewsline.com/articles/<phoneRedac><zipRedac>6<zipRedac><zipRedac>23.html , genetic adaptations for life at high elevations has been found in residents of the Tibetan plateau.

Human evolution is really amazing :)>
257:<I think the key thing is that you are able to cope - everyone's pain threshold is different so there is no defined point where surgery become inevitable you are the person who decides 'I can no longer cope and need assistance'. My mother's surgeon was surprised at how degenerated her hip had got before she decided it was time for her second replacement but she was able to cope with the pain it was the instability that made her mind up.

As rossd says the yoga is going to be a brilliant help physically (for flexibility and balance if nothing else) and I am sure that it must help you cope mentally too.

You go girl!! :-)>
258:<There could be, but have you also seen porters and climbing "Sherpas" (I use quotes because Sherpas are actually a race of people, but an occupation)?  They actually basically do interval training at altitude!  They push really hard, take a break, push really hard, take a break.  I can't do that - I have to go slow and steady or else I will burn out.  THEN many of them will bust out a cigarette and call it "Sherpa oxygen."  Definitely a different perspective on performance at altitude.  :-)>

Anyway, it was something new and unknown which I think contributed to my nervousness.   All part of life's rich pageant though, eh?

I hate the heat, I live in a very hot and wet city (tropical please leave me alone) and if I stay outside my office or house for a while, I start sweating (you would say that's normal) but I rapidly start feeling tired and then my love for the heat decresses even more :) I already knew that heat makes you get tired because I feel it everyday, but now I know WHY!!! my heart tries to dissipate the heat but that makes me get tired... central fatigue!>
262:<Got it ! Thank you :)>
263:<Thanks a lot to both of you for your inputs. 
I think I understand a little better now. Apparently the longer cortisol is at work in our body, the more hunger pangs we are likely to feel. So I guess people do feel like eating when stressed :)
Also I found the science behind the theory that chocolate makes people happy: eating dark chocolate especially -  it reduces stress hormones. Though I didn't think of conditioning as a factor,it was really helpful to know that. Here is an article about the same http://her.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/4/443.full>
264:<Thank you for your reply in another thread, Anne.  What I wrote was both what I heard and what I **copied and* pasted* from captions.  The former could be my auditory discrimination disorder; I think the latter in both the slide and the captions could use some fixing for the next iteration of the class.  "So you're resting and submax ventilation goes up. This is good because it keeps in your alveoli higher."

Your team, in my opinion as an online college professor since 1997, has done an absolutely fantastic job with the first iteration of this course!!!!  Some improvements can be made, but they're few and not tremendously important or difficult to do. Bravo!!!!!!

One suggestion I have would be to put up a list of abbreviations somewhere for those of us who have never seen them before; for instance, "SV = Stroke Volume."

My name is Alex and I'm from Russia. This course is very interesting and helpful  for me, because i really like mountain sport activities such as backcountry and climbing.

267:<Steve, I too am an airline pilot...actually a retired one (a year ago :-) I think we have adapted much to the higher altitude just from our constant life in it.

@katkapps, I don't have evidence but I definitely believe your body has memory about how to acclimatize.  Some of it may be mental (remember the first time you went to altitude and might have been kind of freaked out not expecting how winded you felt?) and some is probably physical.  I can even feel it in the same season...is it just getting more fit? Or is it a sort of "muscle memory" that enables your body to recognize a familiar environment of oxygen deprivation and get to work adapting?  Hard to say, but my gut says my body remembers...>
270:<Yeah!  I find the situation where you "feel fine" and then suddenly get flustered to be the most frustrating.  :-)>
271:<Actually, no, I don't know exactly what the physiological cause is...why it takes from minutes to hours to feel the effects.  Definitely has to do with the amount of altitude you have gained and the time frame.  Driving from sea level in SF to Bunny Flat, the trailhead at Shasta (6.8k ft), will get my heart pounding more than hiking around Annapurna Base Camp at 13.5k ft, but that's because I took 7 days to get there.  

I'm sure there are more scientific formulas and rates out there, but it's also so darn individual specific.  One rule of thumb is I have always heard (based on studies) was to try not to gain more than 1,000ft gain per day to avoid AMS, but we have pretty much blasted that rule on any real mountain due to the terrain, logistics, the balance between time spent at altitude and time acclimatizing, etc etc.

Nope, haven't climbed Everest yet!  It's still a goal (so still tell Justin Merle I said "hi").  To reference one of your other posts, I also don't have the 60k (or the 40k in my case as I would not hire a Western guide).  It's tough for the average climber to get to Everest due to the cost.  My "claim to fame" is Makalu - the 5th highest mountain - which cost around $10k (no guides but logistical support, cooks, porters).  No one has ever heard of it, so it fails to impress, but it's far more difficult than Everest.  AND I only made it to Camp 2...so most people are like "Oh, you didn't summit..."   But what they don't realize is that every decision on an 8,000m could be your last.  I chose to live another day and keep climbing.  :-)>
272:<I'd tell my friend to give your regards to Justin Merle, but I don't know your name and there's no way I can find that OpenEdEx will allow personal emails.  I'm certainly not asking your name here (see my not very personally identifiable ID).

I agree with you that this class is outstanding! I'm lovin it :) Have you ever used the glossaries at the end of the sections?

279:<I found the answer. :)

It was explained to me that if my body were under stress as when in a car accident, my blood pressure may very well drop and I won't be able to produce cortisol to raise it.  I'm a small woman; the paramedics would probably decide I was dehydrated and would hydrate me.  I'd then have much too much water in my body and would probably go into congestive heart failure.  In addition to other problems, this would do serious damage to my kidneys and I'd have to deal with that.  The paramedics need to know to give me a cortisone shot rather than hydrate me.>

281:<I hope it's ok to share book tips in here, because I'm reading a book that many participating in this course might find interesting:

"Surviving the Extremes" by Kenneth Kamler, M.D.

![enter image description here][1]

I bought the book before the course start, and it's really interesting.
The chapters are well writen and deal with surviving in
- hot and dry environments ("The Marathon of Sands")
- high altitude ("In the Kingdom of God")
and also junge, high seas, underwater and outer space.

As a MD, Kenneth Kamler is sharing his huge knowledge with the reader in a very clear, well-written way. He has experiences himself as a doctor on high altitude and jungle expeditions, which makes the book the more exciting.
Especially the desert and high altitude chapters I found really interesting, and I tried reading them at the same time those topics were covered here.

The part about high altitude is really fascinating. He describes more of the chronic adaptations to high altitudes in different people and peoples, like differences between the Sherpas in the Himalayas and the Native Indians of the Andes.

Amazon has the book, but I didn't like the picture to it as I wasn't sure if that is ok here.

I'm just recommending the book because it's both entertaining and eductional. Although it's my "bed time book" some of the history don't leave you with pleasent pictures in your mind ;)
But mostly, Kamler delivers a fascinating writing about the human body and its ways of copying with extremes environment.

(Yes, there are shark stories too...you might not want to read those the night before your planned boat-and-swimming week-end trip ;) )

282:<Hi Mariosea!

I can relate to what you are saying about the stress managing suggestions being so "logical" but then there are the emotions interfering (and they seem to be completely contrary to logic sometimes, right?).

I'm struggling with getting overwhelmed by emotions, and are working on resolving that issue. For me, it's as if the emotions come first, and they are so strong that there is simply no place left for logical thougths (like "calm down" "breathe deeply") I just feel more like "exploding".

I must admit that I don't respond very well to usual calming techniques like focus on my breathing (my breathing gets worse when I try to breathe deeply, but it has gotten better over the last years. Yes, *years*.)

So I was glad to hear about the "freeze frame" technique in the course. I think for people reacting emotionally very quickly, this technique might work well. Instead of trying to use logic ("calm down") you first take a break.
Freeze frame. Stop the movie.
Pause it. Look at it.
Then re-evaluate. 
I haven't tried it that often yet (a few times though), and it seems that the "time-out" could provide you a break from the immediate emotional response, and in that break, maybe there could appear a good thought or two, helping you out of the stressed situation?

It is hard work to change our automatic responses to certain situtions. Some situations trigger us more than others, depending on our earlier experiences. But with repetition, learning and new experiences I think we can learn to handle  situations better over time.

At least I myself  have been trying for years, and I get better, even though slowly.
So there is hope to handle those emotions and let logic make your life less stressful! :)>
283:<It's all good! Have a great weekend :)>
284:<@rossd, I'm no expert, but have been above 15k ft about a dozen times and lead people around the world on high altitude treks.  The way I boil it down is that there are the following factors to how one does at altitude:

1. genetics - the part that's hard to control and hard to explain.

2. fitness - your fitness compared to others as well as your personal fitness level.  I can feel radically different on the same exact trip depending on my degree of fitness.

3. personal maintenance - those who do a better job of eating before hungry, drinking before thirsty, managing a pace where you won't have to recover as much each night, etc etc can make a huge difference.  I have seen this stark contrast within groups as well as day by day with the same individual (if one day they push too hard and neglect themselves, but don't the next day)

4. randomness - there are many stories of guides on Denali guiding for decades and then one year coming down with pulmonary edema.  I have had tough days at 6k ft and amazing days at 19k ft without a lot of explanation.

Never take your ability to acclimatize for granted!  :-)>
285:<@marily_j, You can actually find me really easily.  I'm the experiential interview at the end of this module.  :-)  And if you google <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm easy to get to as well.
Well, they just came out with some good news - they lowered the individual climber permit fee from 25k pp to $11k pp.  It will be interesting to see what that does to the dynamic.  I'm not totally convinced it will be bad - the commercial expeditions are screaming, but they tend to be the ones (in my humble opinion) who help bigger groups with less experienced climbers get to the top.  I shouldn't be one to judge though and I'll wait to see.  I just know lots of amazing climbers who can not afford to try Everest, and some not so amazing climbers that are well funded and can afford a large expedition outfitter.  Time will tell!!!>
286:<Yeah, you are right, I think I am a pretty high responder.  I was pretty well trained, but I'm really not a super athletic person.  See the experiential interview - that's me.  

I'd love to get one at home. :-)  I have also heard from Jordan Romero (the youngest kid to climb Everest in 2010) that he and his family used a hypoxic tent if I remember correctly.  They are also freakishly fit as they are all hardcore adventure racing and ultra-marathon pros, but apparently they took some crazy about of time off their acclimatization rotation schedule by arriving very acclimatized...I think the idea has legs!>
287:<First, this was an awesome module!  It may be just a joke, but I seriously wondered why those of use climbers who routinely like to go above 15k ft experience exorbitant farting and burping.  I have coined the terms hafe and hape - high altitude flatulent emissions and high altitude burping emissions - as a play on hace and hape (sorry, the all caps isn't working).

Second, this is a fantastic explanation of something I've always wondered about.  I'm a small somewhat unathletic woman (see the experiential interview) and even if I train my ass off for a climb, I'm still just so much less athletic than most of the other climbers on big mountains.  Yet, the higher we go, the less our difference in performance seems to be.  I'm sure there are some aspects about my approach to climbing at altitude (super conscious of pace and personal maintenance), but it always blew my mind that my crazy fit partners could beat me to camp yet feel horrendous.  I might struggle to get in within an hour or so of my partners, but I would feel great (comparatively speaking that is - hard to feel truly great at altitude).  This makes a lot of sense and resolves a mystery for me.  :-)>
288:<Putting a name and a face to the posts, Emilie. :)  I enjoyed the interview!

This was the link I sent (above).  How much of a difference it will make I don't know.  It's 10,000 dollars a person for seven people and 11,000 dollars by oneself.  As I wrote above, I can see why the HUGE discount of off-season climbing probably won't work to help people who don't have the money.  Whether or not this lowering of the climbing fee will make much of a difference in ANY way I guess remains to be seen.>
289:<After you asked the question, I found it when I watched Module 7 around  minute 7:50 - increased brain blood pressure and increased brain permeability leads to brain swelling...which is painful.  :-)>
290:<Ha ha!  :-)>
291:<Well then this book might be interesting for you! 
The jungle chapter was really fascinating as well. Although not dealing much with physiology of the body in itself, it was fascinating how well the Indians in the Amazone used the jungle's resources in case of medical emergencies. 
The high altitude chapter is exciting too.
Well all of the chapters I've read so far, are good ;)>
292:<Hello,
I am a major in Environmental Science and have been doing this to prepare to do a literature review on the topic as apart of my honours course this year. The course is so awesome. Thanks so much for this Stanford University. :-)>
293:<I think I am falling in love ;)>
294:<Hi there,

I did a lot of hiking in the Alps and Himalaya's and must say in general I noticed altitude starting at 3,000 meters. In the Himalaya's when I arrived at 3,500 meters I had to adjust for a couple of days to a whole week before being able to get started. I really felt like sea sick/ dizzy and hungry for food :-).
 
I hiked mountains at 5,500 meters, and there I definitely felt the difficulty to move forward: 2 step up towards the pass, meant 1 steps down. I almost felt as if I didn't benefit from the running training that I did as preparation.>
295:<Hello!
My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> Saldaña. I got my BSc. in Biology a year ago in Peru (wich is also where I lived) and I am applying to different Neuroscience PhD program in the US.  I love travelling around my country so this course has really give me some awesome practical tips. This is my first online course and i really loved it! :)>
296:<I agree with Marilyn_l. At the earlier modules I managed to lose some points in quizzes because of "check all that apply" questions, but I realized that my attention to the material was kind of superficial then. Now I pay much more attention to module's material and grades are much better. 
In conclusion "check all that apply" are working as intended - do not remove them. 
At the end, we are not at combinatorics course here ;)>
297:<physiology of variable pressure module 1 (the story part) isn't there. Help! :)>
298:<Doug, Nice link. I couldn't have said it better myself :)  Thank you.>
299:<Welcome Rithvikgv, Alpe d'Huez - Fantastic. I'm jealous :)
Enjoy!>
300:<I enjoyed too :)>
301:<Robin, 
Thank you for the reminder. I had heard the interview on my way home just by chance and thought it was great. I even bought his book :) I meant to include the link in the resources section and now I will.  
Doug, thanks for providing the link.>
302:<Pika, 
I think it was the other way around.  We went sky diving over the summer to film the video and they did it this fall.  They couldn't let Corey have all the fun without them.  Your turn :)>
303:<That last part of the video where Anne is summarizing the different things we've learned through the course, and the note about taking care of our bodies etc., nearly had me in tears. This is only my second MOOC and it's been a wonderful experience. It's deepened my interest and willingness to find my passion and learn more about all the different things that intrigue me. There's so much I want to know! And with the wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, literally, through the internet, I just may do that :-) Thanks Anne and Corey for helping to awaken the life-long learner in me!>
304:<Thank you very much. I couldn't agree more, but sometimes it's so irritating how narrow-minded people can be in terms of some simple healthy behaviors. But you are right - we need to do our job as good as we can and provide the best possible example for the others :)>
305:<I have to confess i kinda tried that lung packing thing while you were talking before you warned..............:) Don't think i did it right thou...>
306:<Thank you very much for offering this course, It has been really interesting, useful and amazing, it is a funny way to learn a lot and dont ger bored, even I have laughed sometimes, nice mix :)>
307:<I used to exercise a lot and I could feel its impact on my fitness, emotion and all my life. But because of hard working and studying, I can not go to the gym, and I can feel the decrease of power in my muscles, although I am not old! May this course be the motivation for starting again :)>
308:<Thank you for this wonderful course! I really learned a lot and I enjoyed every single lesson :)>
309:<Hi Everyone,
Such a late introduction, but hopefully, late is better than never.:)
I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I grew up in Menlo Park, CA, just a couple of miles away from the beautiful Stanford campus. My graduate degree was exercise science, but it was soooooo long ago, I wanted a refresher along with more detail about how our bodies work under pressure.  This class has been just the right ticket for both those goals.  Nice to share this experience with so many other students all over the world! 
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
310:<I got choked up at the end when you were talking about how awesome our bodies are! 

Now I want to know what causes *that* physiological response? :)

This was a great class - thank you so much!!>
311:<Me too!! I just posted the same thing! :)>
312:<I am also very interested in cold therapy for both the physical and emotional aspects. I live on the Gulf of Mexico and swim the Gulf year around, never using my wetsuit as the temperatures seldom get below 60F/15.6C. I find these swims very invigorating and seldom use heated water for showers for the same reasons. My experience seems to have been very beneficial, until last fall when I was training for both a 5K winter swim and a 100 mile bike tour. I think I got de-railed by several factors increasing both physical and emotional stresses and perhaps pushing me into chronic stress. I really appreciated Corey modules on stress. I am also 68 years old and may have some age stress too. :)  Now just training for a 5K run, and seem to be sleeping, eating, and training much better. I have reduced the cool swims in both duration and frequency and haven't done hours long bike rides for a while.

Will probably keep the cold showers forever, even when we go to Minneapolis.>
313:<I've been a military pilot for a little over 10 years, and before that I worked at a major theme park for about 5 years (so I'm a confirmed adrenaline junkie ;) ), and I'd agree that (at least anecdotally) it always seemed that kids experienced more motion sickness. I wonder if adults who suffer from extreme motion sickness are more likely to self-select away from situations where they're likely to get sick, or if there is a age-related decline in our ability to handle excessive g-forces, or both? Since fighter pilots are extremely lucky to stay in the cockpit past roughly their mid-40s (due to standard career progression), I don't know if there have been any studies done on the effects of aging on g-tolerance.>
314:<Variability? Looks like this is another area of different things work for different people. I LOVE cold swims and cold showers. My wife stops swimming when the pool drops below 80F/27C (iPhone's Siri is good at F/C). And she wouldn't take an ice bath  even if it would cure cancer. :)>
315:<Nutrition is critical! If you have been on a western diet most of your life, which your knee replacement suggests, you have been on a high inflammation diet which can cause lots of problems in addition to arthritis. Think of your knees as the canary in the mine. If the canary goes bad, replacing the canary doesn't correct the toxic gas in the mine. 

I was a lifetime runner, maybe 15-25 miles a week on concrete and asphalt. Felt very healthy until my knees started to go at around 50, was told by two sports medicine doctors that it was arthritis and probably time to hang up the running shoes if I wanted to be able to walk the rest of my life. 

I gained 30 pounds that year. Joined a gym, got a trainer, took up 'sophisticated' exercise, instead of street running. Didn't lose much weight, but moved some of it to more flattering locations, muscles. (Side benefit: Women are much more impressed with men who look like they could beat-up a bear, rather than escape by out running their date should a bear appear. :) SAM-e, a natural enzyme which decreases with age, seems to help prevent much of the pain (maybe some of the damage?) of inflammation in joints. I have used the Nature Made brand for over 15 years with some success. I also took up inline skating and biking as low impact sports.

Last year after not being able to run for over 15 years, I tried the Wheat Belly diet/lifestyle by Dr. William Davis, hoping to lose a few pounds. Within 10 days the arthritis pain in my knees and other joins DISAPPEARED. This is a very healthy high fat/low carb lifestyle. It isn't clear if the huge health benefits being reported by users (though not the media) are because it eliminates wheat and other grains, sugar and high fructose corn syrup, or GMO foods which because of the large number of new proteins do cause inflammation in many people.

I have bought NEW RUNNING SHOES and after over 15 years of not running, I am now successly training for a 3 mile/5K race in a couple of months. I just turned 68. Joint pain quickly returns if I go off diet or accidentally get wheated, but most days I feel 20 years younger!

My skin (which used to be thin and frail) and hair have both improved dramatically. I used to need a pad to kneel (for maintenance) on our rather smooth pool deck to prevent injuries that took a long time to heal. Now my skin is so thick and tough I really think I could crawl bare-kneed down our somewhat rough sidewalk. I have also used cold showers and swims during thi>
316:<Lynnerev, 
Very interesting. I had never heard of this.  I will give it a try next time I feel sudden stress...and hope the people around me don't think I am having a bowel movement.  I can see myself up on the graduation speaker stage bearing down :)  No,seriously, I'm going to try it. 
I hope your son is doing well.>
317:<I've heard people talk about fluids in the middle ear and crystal formation, but not enough to understand the mechanism behind it. I have seen elderly (and obese) individuals with symptoms that mirror those associated with G Force challenges -who have been found to have excess CSF in the spinal column/ brain. I know you mentioned thicker fluid, could that mean increased CSF? Could the pressure changes (like we experience on a roller coaster) precipitate increased flow of spinal fluid in the elderly? If they already have increased CSF, these pressure changes could result in more pronounced symptoms?
Thanks,
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> :)>
318:<I think all modules are great, my favorites were stress and aging. Anne & Corey are wonderful teachers and researchers ;) ;] Congratulations this course is a hit!>
319:<This final week is definitely my favorite ! I got to live out my fantasies of flying fighter jets and experiencing space travel vicariously through the G-forces video and the podcast !  This was a very pleasurable week… I thoroughly enjoyed it !… The scientific information is useful also :-) . 

Just 2 weeks ago I read *Eagle in The Sky* by Wilbur Smith in which the effects on the fighter pilot while climbing very fast in the air were described. One thing the pilot did to ameliorate the rush of blood draining from his head was to scream. I was wondering if that was why Corey kept going "Whoohoo" while flying …or was that just excitement ? 

Again, thank you all so very much for this series. :-)>
320:<It's been awesome. I got to learn so much about environmental physiology.
As well as that a lot about exercise physiology in general. It has been a good place start coming from an Environmental Science background to do future studies in exercise physiology as well as generally learning so much about how the body works and what to do to age gracefully.

Thank you so much for providing this too guys. :-)>
321:<I just wanted to say that I realized this part (physiology of aging) by my heart. I am not too old, may can say I am young (in the age of 33) ;) but I can feel the differences from my 20 decade! And also I can feel the effect of regular exercise. So suggesting to every body: KEEP EXERCISING.  and to the course team: THANK YOU FOR THIS MARVELOUS SECTION :)>
322:<First of all I wanted to say that the story was very exiting, specially with its fantastic rhythm of music at the beginning of the excitement!! That was also really impressing. And I wanted to congratulate Corey with his well-done job :)>
323:<Yes, it would be very good to know more about it. 
It feels pretty much like after being on the boat. IMHO it is a purely neurological phenomena vs a physical change at sensor level. But something interesting does happen during sustained violent maneuvers. For instance, after completing accelerated spins, difference between horizon and where I felt horizon should be was ~30-40degrees - it took a conscience effort to bring plane back there. Very odd feeling, which seemingly was not "transitional" and lasted for a few seconds. [Though it is hard to judge it - and time - objectively. You would climb high, then enter normal spin, then transition to flat power-on spin, then tip nose down, and then, man, it goes :-) Plane I flew (basic aerobatic trainer) did ~4 turns in 5 seconds, loosing about 500-600ft/turn. And then you need to recover in reverse order. Not enough time for reflection. :-) 
I just know this effect is not unique to myself. ]

On a tangent, I think "read-out" neither was never conclusively explained, nor even reproduced in lab environment (mostly due to grave danger to eyes, even by standards of old glory days with unlimited money and human experiments in 50s and 60s).>
324:<Connecting this section to the first section, and based on my own experience, the first  response of my body that I recognize is to get cold, specially in my fingers and toes. Also goosebumps and sweating.This is the indication of putting the stress out by the body... SO interesting!! :)>
325:<You're welcome, Astrolin!  Also, you're a *volunteer* EMT.  That certainly has to count for SOMEthing!  Have your superior write a good letter of recommendation; if that's not his/her forte, write it yourself or have it written for you and ask him/her to make any changes and then to sign it.

People write their own job descriptions because no one *really* knows what they do better than they, themselves; there's no one who knows the great job better you do better than you. :)  Take it with you and personally hand it to whomever you're developing a rapport with.  This could be the chair of the PA department; it doesn't have to be admissions.  Make an appointment to talk about the school and the program, ostensibly to decide if you want to apply or not.  After all, you've heard it was a great program and you want to see for yourself!!! :)>
326:<One thing more -- if you seem to be getting along well, ask this person what you can do to get around the 3.0 problem; of course, prior to asking, you'll have talked about all the great things about yourself that will make the person want to help you, want not to miss having you in that school. :)>
327:<Unless you were traveling at near the speed of light, then everyone on Earth will age much faster than you! :)>
328:<It's a well-known and laughed about phenomenon among Yosemite employees at Tuolumne Meadows (elevation 8600 ft)! Beer makes you belch more, too. 

Good times :)>
329:<Aging was my favorite - it inspired me to get back in/ keep in shape, active and healthy so I don't reach that "threshold of disability," a term/way of looking at aging that I hadn't seen before. The graphs really helped me to see it clearly. Thank you!

My second favorite was altitude because I like to get high! haha. In altitude, of course :) I love the mountains and hiking and peak bagging, but I'm getting old, so the aging section helped me think about how to KEEP getting up there (in altitude), while I'm getting up there (in age). :)>
330:<Oh yay! Looking forward to the bloopers :)>
331:<This reminded me of a great story about eccentric exercise I read a while back - I found it! It also has excellent diagrams of muscle fibers and explanations that might be useful, but the memorable part for me was the story at the bottom. One of his students, for a senior seminar, took him to the gym "for a relatively easy hour of working out in the weight room, concentrating on eccentric exercise." The next morning he could barely move! The student used him as a "prop" in his seminar. Another example of an instructor giving their all for science, the way Anne and Corey do!! :)

Here's the article: [Why do muscles hurt after exercise?][1]

332:<Wow, thanks! The reason why I mentioned excess CSF is because, from time to time, I see patients in the ER with CSF pressures in excess of 10+ mmHg from normal as measured during a lumbar puncture) and they are walking around in a normal fashion (with the exception of some of the signs and symptoms I mentioned). Yes, increased CSF does mean increased ICP, but we still see fairly 'normal' people with increased CSF. Increased swelling around the optic nerve can be visualized on exam, etc. Its amazing to see!

Thanks again! :)>
333:<I would also like to thank you for this extraordinary experience! It has been interesting, inspiring, useful, mind blowing on occasions, simply amazing! 

Last year I began to bike to work and I was intrigued by the way my body adapted first to the heat of the summer months and then to the cold of winter and how what seemed impossible in the beginning became comfortable enough after a while. I remember thinking: our bodies are amazing! I wish I could find out more about their ability to adapt to the environment :)

And my wish came true, a friend sent me the promotion video and I signed up immediately.

I was afraid in the beginning that I wouldn't understand much given my lack of background in sciences, but you've thought that might be a problem and created the glossary. Thank you! Also you've managed to present the information in such a way that I've never had the problem of not being able to follow you. Not only the topics were interesting to start with, but the story videos made them even more attractive and the modules are logically organised, divided in manageable chunks, not too much yet not too little information presented in such a professional way. And the expert interviews... Well, I've felt like I got the opportunity to personally meet all the experts and that is one more precious gift, so thank you again.

There's a lot of knowledge to put into practice, I've made notes so that I don't forget the most important bits and I hope to make you proud! 

Thank you again and greetings from Croatia to all the members of your wonderful team - you are a great example of the winning combination for success: hard work and lots of fun.

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>

P.S. I hope I've posted this where I was supposed to :)>
334:<Sure! Are you a nurse? I just finished nursing school, so I'm still in "study mode" :)>
335:<Congrats on finishing school! Study mode is good- even after you're done with your boards :) You are very resourceful- an incredible asset! I'm a respiratory therapist... most of my friends are nurses :) Much luck and happiness in your new career - what a joyful ride!>
336:<Indeed. :-) Humans are definitely not designed for flight without visual reference.
One can have an easy demo by closing eyes and trying to hold a car steady on _empty_ road, say for only 10 seconds. That is on firm road in 2D. Compare this with a real plane moving in 3D, in the cloud or in the pitch black night, without ability to stop at will when things are hard, as car can do.
There is a galore of various illusions body can award a pilot in those conditions. :-)>
337:<I would like to ask something that would be interesting to yoga practitioners: what is known about being in suspended inversion. 
This is less extreme, but similar to -Gz exposure.

Apparently brain is well protected by same inflexible cranium that present a problem when brain swells. In inversion, non-compressible CSF prevents changes in cranial blood vessel caliber. Thus (counter-intuitively) there is no danger of cerebrovascular hemorrhage. 
There is a significant BP increase in veins and arteries of the neck, with transudation of fluid into the tissues of neck and face (esp. if muscles are relaxed). Because of this, blood volume may fall (although that may be compensated by blood draining from the lower extremities and pelvis). Eyes are at most risk (people with glaucoma beware). Carotid reflex causes slow down of heart and dilation of arterioles. That in turn lowers differential between arterial and venous BP, with consequent drop of capillary pressure gradient. That, in prolonged inversion, can lower cerebral perfusion enough to cause blood stagnation and local hypoxia.    

That's a theory, anyway.
Is anything more known about this? Other compensatory mechanisms and extent of their protection?

There is something going on with long exposure - word has it, some people in Timothy Leary merry circle were standing on the head for hour on end to get high. :-)

Sirsasana (headstand) considered to be a queen of asanas in yoga.
Plenty of benefits, provided one's neck is strong enough and butt is light enough not to finish one's cervical spine. 
 

On [somewhat :-)] related note:

Any explanation on why hemorrhoids considered to be an occupational hazard for fighter pilots? [At least that is what I read.]
Can frequent butt clench cause that much stagnation of venous blood in pelvis? It seems it should promote circulation instead.
 
Reason why I ask, this is also quite relevant -- sitting in meditation poses  for long time (with leg positions that do not promote circulation, such as lotus, etc.) might have similar effects in that case (especially if not countered). 
Anyone has something to say about this?>
338:<Is light affect human as it affect plants? :) Is working through the night and mostly sleeping through the day impacted negatively on human health? Some of my friends answer positive to these questions, they believe that human is day creature and must be mostly active through the day and rest at night, they often say about "natural biorhythms". It is true, that unregular work/sleep regime sometimes negatively impacted on cognitive functioning and stress level, but what if we completely shift our activity at 12 hours. Is some scientific pros and cons for that?>
339:<Interesting... I do something I call "harnessing the power of procrastination" - when I'm procrastinating, I will do almost anything else first, so I pick the most odious tasks, ones that I would procrastinate doing if it weren't for this other, more dreaded thing, that I'm currently putting off. It's amazing how much (else) I can get done while procrastinating!! 

But procrastinating, for me, anyway, also creates a more chronic low grade stress - that feeling niggling at your brain that you're an idiot and should be working on the dreaded object of your procrastination, thinking about it more, worrying about it, etc. The longer I procrastinate, the larger it looms, until, when I finally do it, whether it's a big project or just a dreaded task, I wonder why it seemed like such a big deal.

There definitely is a powerful burst of energy and focus in the brinksmanship game that is procrastination as well, though. Which might be a kind of "good stress" to harness.

It might be a wash in terms of stress response, but on the other hand, whatever works for you in getting things done. Sometimes I can change my perspective on a project - "creative" style is to let it percolate, simmer on the back burner, and then when it comes out, it's almost done the first time. That *feels* like procrastination, but maybe isn't, and is a necessary part of your process. You are actually working on the project in the back of your mind, thinking it through, so when you are finally ready to (or forced to by time constraints) tackle it, it comes out better. 

Funny story: Once I was procrastinating writing a speech for a class... I was giving it Monday night, and I woke up Sunday morning remembering I had dreamed about giving the speech. In my dream, I didn't have it, but I got up there with blank cards and spoke about procrastination. When I woke up, I thought, "AHA!! I'll do my speech on procrastination - a subject I know very well!" I had a book on procrastination that I hadn't gotten around to reading yet (of course!) and so I used that for research, and opened my speech by telling about my dream. I got an A on the speech. :)

So, the mind works on these things even when you are not conscious of it!>
340:<I can write a whole list of "improvements" for the forums.  One of them would be the digest that's sent for posts I'm following.  It's *almost* a complete waste.

A. It comes only once a day -- I've already been in class by the time I get it.

B. It shows only part of a post; so, I have to go to the forum.

C. Re: B -- It doesn't take me to the post, but rather to the main page of the forum. I then have to find the post I want.

Coursera's notification feature is really good on this.  Coursera isn't at the top of my list of platforms I've used as either a student or professor, but it has this one right (in my opinion). :)>
341:<I thank you for this information, Karl. :)  I think I might not have been clear in my question and I apologize for this.  My problem is that I don't understand how the floating feeling fits into the lecture on microgravity.  Enough time was made of it that it's probably important, but I can't see how it relates! :(>
342:<Since staff hasn't answered, I have a feeling that the reason isn't known.  It would be an interesting doctoral dissertation. :)>
343:<Thanks a lot Corey :)>

346:<I Don`t think so! I believe we have to learn how to manage it, and this course is trying to teach us such a thing :)>
347:<Wish you all good luck :)>
348:<Yeah. That "deep breath" really works. But the important point is that you have to remember doing such a thing when you are angry!! practicing will help :)>
349:<My own experience when getting sad or stressed is that my body temp. falls, like the time that blood temp. falls and you need to lie down. When I go asleep, everything changes! and after waking up I feel really better. But vice versa going to bed without sleeping make me worse. This is a technique I have created for myself and it works for me!! :)>
350:<Yeah, despite lack of time I have, every day I come back from work enthusiastically to learn a new thing from this course :)
Thanks a lot :))))>

358:<Yes, Cantfindaunusedid. :)  But what does this have to do with the large amount of space devoted in the lecture to the feeling of floating?  I understand the physics; that's not a problem.  The problem is why the feeling of floating was emphasized.>
359:<Shane! Would love to help you on your way to get a statement with distinction :) I have a guess about what is going on... Is where the bar would be replaced with a little black 'x'? The lowest 4 scores for CFU are dropped, which means only the top 30 of the 34 CFU's count for your grade. This is to help boost the scores! If you have already completed over 30 of the CFU's this may be why that is happening. 

If that doesn't seem right, let me know and we will do a deeper investigation!>

Because, simply we just didn't have the 19th question (3.19), instead; we continued from 20th question (3.20).
Since the topic was "Exercise and the Brain", I also expect another question about the 22th question (3.22) because there was two "e" in it instead of the "f" in the end, which was the correct answer...
So, I don't believe that these are some "bug"s, I think they were there on purpose.. or I'm just over-thinking as always =)
So, what do you people think about it..?>
372:<Hello there..
I know it's a bit (maybe more than a "bit"..) late, but unfortunately, it's kind of a normal thing in my life. My name is Temuçin <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, I'm from Republic of Turkey.
I'm currently studying in two universities at the same time. And I'm currently part-time-ish working as a Martial Arts and sports coach. The thing is, I will keep studying in Archaeology and after; the Turkology when I graduate from these two current departments... So, this course was what I was looking for for along time to develop myself and learn from the real experts that I can use in my private and professional life in the future.. which since this course way highly related with my job and interests, I studied so hard... I mean, also, since it was a delicious course with this beloved teachers, learning was not an obstacle or something to "dealt with".. thank you so much! I hope our "way"s would cross again in the future courses or studies(in "EP102" maybe..? =] ) somehow~>
373:<Hi Manni, thanks for adding to the discussion on SCUBA. 
As a researcher in this area myself, I was very interested in this section of the course and your post :-)
You are right about PFOs, these are indeed common in the general population, and we have some evidence the prevalence in the active SCUBA divers population is actually increased (maybe due to repeated valsalva manoeuvers?).
The relationship between DCS and bubbles is not a clear cut one. We know that the more bubbles observed post dive the higher the chance of getting DCS, however there are a lot of inter-personal differences and personal tolerance to the bubbles (and how well venous bubbles can get filtered by the lungs and not appear in the arterial circulation). The component of inflammatory response linked to DCS is also being studied, and we need not forget that the scuba diving environment is a lot more than a simple pressure change. Effects of temperature, oxidative stress (pO2 increased), immersion, exercise, etc are combined into this environment.>
374:<Feeling awed and a bit dumbfounded after following along with Dr. Friedlander and Corey through the six weeks of serendipitous adventure. At 64 years of age, luckily still not under any formal medication except for levothyroxin on my thyroid, I'm now challenged with forming a plan on how to age efficiently. I don't run, but use a set of 8 lb weights to workout, walk briskly in the park, cleaning, cooking, and a tiny bit of gardening constitute my daily physical activity.  I live in a duplex in suburban Los Angeles.  Not quite sure how to up my VO2 Max and endurance, need your input, my fellow healthy comrades:)>
375:<I've done the same. Even having a library of these videos doesn't take away the sadness! ;)>
376:<The breathing excise was amazing! It's like pure nirvana! :)>
377:<Since they offer a <del>bribe</del> prize for posting in the forums, here I go....

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Romania, computer sysadmin / programmer and former physicist. I found the course entertaining and learned a few things in the process :)>
378:<gret course really informative, im really happy with the result achieved:) thank you>
379:<I'm a last year med student, and of course I have studied physiology, you'd think "probably she already know all of this" but the truth is that I found the course quite interesting and a lot of new knowledge, I live in a developtment country (Guatemala) and aging module inspired me to educate the population more about how to age healthy in poor areas, how minor changes could make a great difference and that health isn't just for "rich people" as some people think here, things like increasing your physical activity doesn't even require necessarily to go to the gym. As my post says education = knowledge = change. 

Thank you for the inspiration and for taking your time for this course, I'm so glad I'm taking it.

P.S. It also encouraged me to stop just sitting and studying to go outside and move! I also want a healthy aging ;)>
380:<Thanks so much for such an interesting course :-)  I would have found it really interesting to have had a module on Hunger.  So many cultures in the world have learned to adapt their way of life to the climate/altitude they live in (heat/cold/altitude, etc), but hunger is something which effects so many sections of our global community.>
381:<Perhaps you could dispose (or steadily reduce the use) of "labor-saving devices", motor cars or even TV remote controls. Perhaps make greater exercise and effort integral to your life, rather than an adjunct. Perhaps take on one project that you have always had an interest in but thought too hard or beyond your capabilities. Not sure I want to "age efficiently" - I think I'd prefer to age inefficiently - physical aging per se has little going for it. Be involved, be happy.  :-)>
382:<I also want to say "Thank you!" for this amazing course! :)
I'm sure that everything that I learned will be useful in my everyday work/sport/other activities!

Thank you! It has been a pleasure for me to be part of this experience! :)>
383:<Cortical inhibition and physiological flooding, best ever explanations of stress response! great to know the secret behind! Now it makes more sense why that hands sweating while having exams makes me feel awkward :D>
384:<This is my first online course thanks to Mr. Hakuna Matata who introduced it to me:)!>
385:<Hi, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. Too much time ago I had a course of physiology in my University (Kazakhstan). Now I find again so incredible facts from our body's systems and their responses to different conditions of life. I was really enjoied. Thank you a lot Corey and Dr. Anne, thank you Stanford University for possibility participate in this course!:-)>
386:<Great course, I had no previous experience with physiology and it certainly entered my interests list:)>
387:<I also generally find it easier to run in the cold than run in the heat. 

Within a certain temperature range, body warms up pretty quickly and i don't slow down as much.

Tried this with marathons. I was a LOT slower in heat. :)>
388:<Looking up various curiosities about free diving, I found this interesting video about Herbert Nitsch diving his 214m dive in 2007.

As you can see, he's diving down with a weight (and that's totally unsurprising) — his total dive was 4:24 minutes (and that's totally surprising). Also there's a curious use of a coke bottle as a pressure equalizer :)

Here's the video: http://vimeo.com/<zipRedac>52929>
389:<you have to consider the fact that,the suit was created to mimick the body of unhealthy aging.. Meaning physically healthy old people this effects are minimal to none.. like the 70year old sprinter :)>
390:<I know this is possible from personnal experience,i have been a competitive swimmer since i was 8years old,when i was 17 i got a nasty elbow injury that sidelined me for 21months,through phiosiotherapy and most importantly DETERMINATION,i can back better and stronger i got my University scholarship because of swimming :),Basically it all comes down to the type of exercise,your desire and doing what works for your body or age.>
391:<How wonderful to learn how our bodies can work to keep our lungs and ribcages from smashing at so much preasure! I enjoyed this lesson!!! :)>
392:<I think avoiding sick people is one of the best practices. Some people doesn't mind getting sick so they go about their lives like nothing is wrong. I personally find this annoying, and staying home has so many benefits that it's just ridiculous to pretend everything is fine. For starters, no bug is spread (major benefit). Second, at least in theory, the magnitude of the cold should be less since the bug doesn't have to go all rambo to get "control" of the host (meaning taking no unnecessary antibiotics). And finally, since the body is resting, it can use all the necessary energy to fight off the bug. So why pretend? Why, oh why?! ... Let's stay home =)>
393:<What about sauna or Russian banja with it's contrast treatment? Is it OK after 50? Any recommendations for older sauna lovers? ;)
Thanks and be healthy! :)>
394:<But indeed...I learned bunch of interesting things :) So you did your job!>
395:<The same here :) Very inspiring!>
396:<Wow so interesting!! thanks Standford University :)>
397:<Hi! :)

My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Sweden and I have taken this class purely based on my interest of the human body and what it is capable of. I have no academic background in the field of physiology, but non-the-less a great personal interest in fitness, nutrition and wellbeing. 

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
398:<Absolutely agree; it was fun, educative, perfectly prepared and wonderfully executed. I will miss the lectures :) Thank you!>
399:<And Cory was very much handsome ;)>
400:<I am very happy to have finished the course. Due to the problems that we are facing in Venezuela and a very bad internet connection I thought I wouldn't make it. But I'm glad I did it and I will never EVER forget the Fick equation :) 
Thanks to Dr. F and Corey for the time and dedication. 

Regards, 

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
401:<Thank you all for creating such a great course. You are both hilarious and I learned so much along the way. This was such a cool experience. Please make more courses together! I would like to continue to learn! :-)

Thanks again. Enjoy a wonderful year!>
402:<Whet we get a statement? I really want to get it. :)))>
403:<Great course. Hope it's not too late for one question.

Skydivers in the freefly discipline will often fly head down, i.e. head first, at terminal velocity in freefall. Example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7zQzKVGq2w

If you stand on your head, the blood rushes to the head and you end up very red faced. The same doesn't happen in freefall. Why?>
404:<Hello,

i don't know if the forum is still working but i would be super interested in discussing the wrks of James O'Keefe and Carl Lavie about the acceleration of atherosclerosis in endurance sport practicioneers.

http://heart.bmj.com/content/99/8/516
and the danish cohort : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/<phoneRedac>9

This frightens me a bit and i find it a little bit controversial with what i've understood in the coorse about hign intensity training, even in the elderly

i hope the forum is still active :)>
