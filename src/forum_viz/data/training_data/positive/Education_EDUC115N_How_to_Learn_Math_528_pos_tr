0:<Hello everybody

I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, an engineer who became a teacher as I wanted to learn more about everything. Have so far ended up learning more about myself than anything else :-). Am today teaching mathematics and technology (yes, it's a separate subject in Sweden) at years 7-9 (13-16 years) and most of the time enjoy my work.

In this course I do hope to learn more about different approaches to teaching and of course learning that I do most things wrong in the class room. Hopefully I learn something about myself along the way.

Thank you for reading. /<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>

2:<Isn't it curious how many people (adults and children alike) view math as difficult instead of fascinating and useful? When I read the course description for "How to Learn Math" I was intrigued to say the least. :)
I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I have taught both preschool and kindergarten; this coming school year I'll be teaching second grade. We're making the shift to Common Core Standards and I am looking forward to delving more deeply into math where in the past state standards have forced us to move very quickly, only covering the surface of many mathematical concepts. 
I also have two sons, ages 10 and 12. My intention is to learn both as a teacher and a parent.>
3:<Hello,
I teach math entirely online to students in grades 5 through 11.  All of my students struggle with math and I am looking for new ways to reach them. :)

4:<Hey, y'all! I think I'm one of the few people taking this course who is not a math teacher. I'm actually a part-time English teacher in Mexico. However, I am also an engineering student, and I love all things math. I'm very excited as this is the first online course I've taken, and I'm sure the knowledge I acquire from the lessons is bound to help me in my studies one way or another. It makes me very happy to see that there are math-lovers a-plenty, and I'm looking forward to learning along with you all! :)>
5:<Hi Janet! 

I too am a second grade teacher and want the exact same thing you do :) 

Katie>
6:<I'm also a middle school math teacher, and I definitely agree with your statement that often times it's just necessary to explain a concept or skill that is lacking. My comments above are definitely what would happen in my "dream classroom" :). I have similar struggles about feeling like I am not using the best possible teaching strategies for my classroom, or I don't have enough time. I, too, am hoping this course, will help me find ways to improve my own practice and ultimately allow me to provide an even better experience for my students.>
7:<Hi Everyone!  My name is Katie K. and I've really been looking forward to this course and even more so now that I see there are other 2nd Grade teachers taking it :)  I'm hoping to bring more discussion and creative learning to my math instruction.  It's just been a couple years since I actually started to enjoy math and stopped saying "I'm horrible at math, or I'm not a math person!"  I honestly believe my excitement has transferred to my students and for the first time I have more students saying their favorite subject is math not reading.  Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge with me!>
8:<I recently became a Math teacher.  I trained as a World Languages Teacher (German and French) and then retrained as an Elementary Literacy Specialist in the US.  Only three years ago did the opportunity arise for me to teach Math in First Grade at a school where students have a dedicated Math teacher all the way pre-K through 5.  I always loved Math and so jumped at the chance, but since taking the job I have been astounded at people's reactions to me as a "Math teacher".  You can see the fear in their eyes as I tell them what I do.  It is as if I have become a different breed of person.  Because I teach Math.  Some of my close friends have opened up about their own traumatic experiences in Math class and yes, those memories run deep.  Even I remember the year that I sat in 5th form Maths (UK) and just could not understand longitude and latitude to save my life.  

So one of my main goals as a first grade Math teacher (I would argue my most important goal) is to make sure that ALL of my students like Math.  I make them work hard, but I also make sure that all of their learning and their risk-taking is done in a safe environment where we learn from our mistakes.  

And I am soooo enjoying teaching Math :)   And I am looking forward to understanding my subject matter so much better after this course.>
9:<I get an exclamation mark. I click on the assessment bar and it says that I need to be instructed on how to assess. It does not allow me to see the instructors guide on how to assess. I have 13, currently in my box to look at and respond to but I can't seem to get past the review, or to do the instructors review. Thanks for your help. :)>
10:<Hi All!  My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am a primary/junior teacher from Ontario, Canada...next year I will have a 1/2 split.  I have worked in an inquiry school for the last 3 years and teach math through inquiry, 3-part lessons, games, mini-lessons, etc.  I am always looking for ways to improve my teaching, and of course, student achievement.  I am looking forward to learning with all of you :)>
11:<Welcome!   Hopefully you'll discover some new things about math... and learning it... and also, how to handle it when somebody does that "oh, you must be good at math, then.. UGH!" thing to you :)>
12:<This really has made me think about modifications and accommodations which are made for students; especially those with special needs or learning disabilities. Listening to the information provided in this session, I would say ALL students in the classroom should attempt the same challenges.  And although, the work may appear to hard or too challenging, it is important for students, parents and teachers to understand the brain development which is occurring in such situations. Too often teachers are afraid to give students challenging work (or work where the solution is not easily found) feeling that it is beyond the scope of the students. Little do they know that something greater than "learning" is occurring:)>
13:<I also went to an all girls' school and I was one of the ones that felt "not good at math" but was streamed into the academic higher math sections regardless due to a perception that my ability was greater than my outcomes :)>
14:<Hi Krista, I'm excited that we'll bring a Cdn. perspective to the group together :) I've never heard of an 'inquiry school' - looking forward to hearing more about how you use the inquiry process in your classroom.>
15:<"I don't care about the rule right now"
"Can anyone make sense of this"
"Put your hands down"
"Because the rule works - isn't good enough"

I loved how the teacher allowed the students who had an incorrect answer to show what they thought and talk out loud with their peers about why they thought they were correct.  I also thought that when they changed their mind, she still took the time to make sure they were accurate in their process before just pushing forward.

How does this work in a differentiated class of students?  Does this pace allow for content to be covered in the allowable time?

Great video, I love the course so far, I have even learned how to work with fractions! :)>
16:<Welp, there are almost 500 answers in there now --- wow!  --- seems some "calibration" stuff still has to happen. There are *obviously* too many fast working high achievers in the bunch ;P>
17:<I'm embarking on the same path as you Jacque. We'll start our journey together here :) -- <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
18:<Hi :) I am in my first year of teaching minus the year I spent student teaching last year.  I will be teaching 6th grade (middle school) math and science core.  Excited!!!>
19:<I have been so frustrated with students who say that can't do something and then throw up their hands. Additionally, I have had support teachers who also believe that a student can't do something and give them the okay to throw up their hands. I would love to share some of the information this information with parents, teachers and students. Recently, I have become focused on standards based grading, students revising their work and moving away from percentage grades. One reason being their focus on the grade. "Mrs. <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, how can I get a 90% because right now I have an 89%. I want to be on high honors." Rarely, is there a mention of wanted to learn more. One idea which has popped into my mind is asking students to reflect more on what they have learned. I think of the KWL organizers that are so common in the schools and not so common in my class. I now see a value of completing this out with students so they can reflect on what they have learned and less on a grade. A job for me now? Integrate other ways in which I can move away from the fixed mindset of grading and more into a growth mindset. Maybe making some purchases from Vistaprint to focus on positive learning feedback is a step:)>
20:<I have been thinking of the two interventions shared so far with the "I believe in you" statement and the goal writing at the beginning of the year. I am thinking in math to have my students come up with three goals they have for math this year. This would be a graded assignment (turned in with three goals math related 100%) 

Then I could at the end of the year have them reflect on how they did on reaching these goals and can use the goals as a conversation to check in with them throughout the year. 
I think that will give the students some say in their math learning as well as helping me help the student reach their math goals for the year. And letting them know that I care about what they want to learn as well :)

I have also in the past had students send me word problems that they created and used them with permission in a live lesson on story problems which gave them a feeling of ownership as well in the class.>
21:<I love the idea of goal reflection and conferencing with the students. I do this with my students and it gives me an opportunity to listen to their challenges and respond to them personally. Great idea! :)>
22:<I like the visual input and community building involved in this activity. I particularly like that you also share your feelings about Math. Students often see us infallible and this helps them realize teachers are human beings. :) Great idea!>
23:<I love the idea of having them take a survey on their learning styles! This will allow you to differentiate the instruction and tailor the lessons to help them access the content more readily. I'm going to use your idea for myself this year. ;)>
24:<Hi Betsy! I am not a librarian, but I too am here to learn strategies to support teachers in their transition to the Common Core. I look forward to learning and growing with you :)>
25:<Pinterest. Pinterest. And more Pinterest! :)
I find that the STEM and Humanities resources into which I have tapped there (along with learning about online opportunities like this course) are in rich abundance on the Pinterest boards. The educators there are generous with sharing their ideas, worksheets, projects and Web 2.0-friendly resources.>
26:<I love the phrase that you used: "Math is the language of science" -- very true! I think almost ALL subject areas are a form of conversation, building a vocabulary in that given discipline and sharing your knowledge with others to build a collaborative experience -- a learning discourse.

I hope that you and your sister enjoy taking the course together. I'm sorry that I didn't think to ask my cousin to take this one with me now. :)>
27:<You asked me, "How surprised are you by the information and data I have just presented?"

Not in the slightest. Data is regularly used to convey emotional responses, from numbers that should seem shocking to most, but to some of us, not at all. I shouldn't be shocked as much as I should be disappointed. Somewhere (for these students in the study) they are being forgotten. I don't want to place blame, basically because I cannot say with certainty where it should be placed. But in a first-world country, the American government should be ashamed to say that over 90% of students can't pass a 2-year College program because of 1 course. 


Next you asked me to answer the question, "How does this connect, if at all, with your own students or your own reason for taking this course?"

Well, for my opinions stated above is the precise reason that I connect  with this course. I am a first year teacher, so in fact I am 'Greener" than most students. I hope to gain some knowledge about pedagogy, strategies in the class, and resources to help me growth as an 'Educator'.  But mostly, and maybe truthfully, I hope to hear stories that make me cry, laugh and reflect about why Math(s) is both a challenge for some, and a strength for others. I really want to approach teaching Math as an opportunity for everyone...including, no scratch that, especially me:)>
28:<Hi everyone! My name is Angie and I am really excited to learn about Math and how to help my daughter and students be successful in math.

I love to collaborate, share and learn from others :)>
29:<Hi everyone!
My name is Angie and I am a 4th/5th grade bilingual teacher in TX. I am very excited to learn new strategies that might help my students be successful in my classroom. 

I love to collaborate, share and learn from others :)>
30:<I like this idea:)>
31:<Hi David, 
I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from California. I also teach Algebra 1 (8th grade Middle School). I look forward to collaborating with you and share resources to best meet the needs of every student. Although we are at the opposite ends of US, we will be united by Common Core Standards curriculum!! :)>
32:<I am a Middle School math special education teacher. We went to national standards last year and it was challenging. There will be changes this year and the more I can add to my bag of tricks the better. Thanks for offering such an interesting topic for such a great price :). We begin school August 2 this year so I will be involved in the course while teaching, should be stimulating.>
33:<glad to know I am not alone. I am sad because I would really like to see what ya'll had to say. I did not try to upload a map. I just wrote in the text box. 
:)>
34:<Hello all,

This is so incredible the many who are taking this course from all around the world. I live in Indiana, and have taught many years ranging from 1st grade to 7th grade math. I am currently teaching with an online math intervention program, Think Through Math (TTM), and work with hundreds of students on a daily basis from all over the United States. The grade range is from 3rd through Algebra 1 students. The immediate response to students' questions is making quite an impact on student learning for the many students using this math intervention software. I am taking this course to continue to build my own skills in developing immediate, open-ended, concept driven questions to encourage students to grow with their own math skills. The best part of any day at work is when a student says, "Oh, now I get it, that makes sense to me now." I look forward to this class learning and sharing with many. :)>
35:<Peer Assessments isn't up and running until the instructor has "calibrated with a few essays" scored, so that may take a while to work. It isn't at all clear from the interface why this wouldn't be working though. :)>
36:<Hello everyone! I am a single mother of 3 children and while I try the hardest to be there for all of them, quite frankly, I am struggling with helping them with their math in school. They all range in age from 2nd grade, 4th grade, and now a junior in high school. I look forward to learning and sharing my experiences here with them! :)>
37:<I agree with Marsha, your baby is super cute. :) Nice to see you here as well, Matt.>
38:<Hi Shannon! 

I'm an adult educator too in Canada (most of my students are in Saskatchewan but I live in Kelowna, BC - ah the beauty of learning/instructing online!) and I certainly can relate to your comments. I'm excited to start this course too :D I'm relieved to see I won't be the only adult educator here, haha. I'm looking forward to learning new ways to engage and support learners in a math classroom. The needs of adult and distance students are very diverse and I'm excited to learn some methods and strategies and I can (hopefully) incorporate into my courses.

~<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
39:<Hi Everyone!

My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I am an online course designer and instructor. I live in Kelowna, BC, though the college I work for is based out of south-eastern Saskatchewan. (Yay for the Internet and open-minded employers, haha!) I work primarily with adult learners and high school students in the areas of Math and Science. I'm really excited to read the diversity of experiences everyone is bringing to this course and I'm greatly anticipating learning a lot from all of you. Recently the math curriculum in Saskatchewan underwent a dramatic shift and so there is a lot of learning going on both sides of the classroom. I've taught high school level math for the past 13 years, but I'm constantly learning there is still so much to learn :D

I'm looking forward to getting to know you all better as the months progress!>
40:<Hi Jan!

I definitely understand exactly what you mean. I'm an adult educator too (see below) and I teach GED prep as well. Many of the adult students who return weren't successful in the 'regular' system and need a new way of learning/doing things. I'm intrigued by the "brain plasticity" concept you mention. I'll have to do some reading up on it :D>
41:<Dear Friends,

Greetings from Bangalore, India! 

An Engineer by education and profession, I now run a small learning lab here. We research and work with education enthusiasts around the world to develop more effective learning methods for today's children.

Math and Science have always been personal favorites, and as part of our research, I get to teach (and learn from) children in K through high school and beyond. Looking forward to learning from all of you and sharing what we have been learning at our lab.

Recently woke up to LinkedIn and have found it to be a great place to connect with teachers and other professionals. See you there as well. :-)

Regards,
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>

42:<I'd be careful about making that assumption. That could lead to the establishment of another stereotype, no? There could be many reasons for more girls enrolling in upper level or honours courses than boys. Is the number of male to female students an equal ratio, for example? If there are more female students than male overall that alone could explain your observation :)>
43:<Hi everyone!  My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I've taught math exclusively for about 4 years now.  I was one of those that did well in math simply because I knew how to follow the rules.  However, working with students, I realized that didn't mean that I was ready to teach them anything :)  I began learning how to teach math.  The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.  And I find myself asking the question, "Why didn't anyone ever tell me that?  It makes so much sense!"  I look forward to learning from all of you.>
44:<That is awesome.  I didn't think that I would ever be a math teacher either, but now I couldn't imagine being anything else :)>
45:<I see I am not the only one with this problem, every time I try to do the peer grading there is a note that says that I need to do the grading practice, then I click and comes something else saying "Not enough calibration essays." And I need to go back. Could you please tell me what I have to do so I can continue? Hope to hear for some answer soon! :)>
46:<<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>: I am taking this course in order to improve the way i present maths to students AND to help my two boys ( not girls :)) feel better about maths.>
47:<I checked out your twitter id...i am already following you it seems! :)>
48:<I too have witnessed this behavior, but fortunately have also observed the flip side. I had a student this past year who verbalized early in the year (1st grade), that he "didn't like math because it was HARD!" Fortunately, come mid year, I had the pleasure in hearing him tell his friend that he "really liked math" and that "it wasn't hard anymore"! :)>
49:<I know you! :)  Glad to see a familiar "face" taking this class.>
50:<I love this activity.  I might steal it.  Hope that's ok. :)>
51:<Is it fair to say that in both cases the problem is poor Human Interface Design?? :)>
52:<Me too:)>
53:<It was Trig and then Calculus where a lot of frustration would happen.  I would fight my way through it but I remember how annoyed I'd get (even though I knew that a good portion was due to my not listening as well as I should have in class :)>
54:<Watching this video, thought I must share this: our learning lab is called "glass"... :-)>
55:<What a great idea!  I'm going to try this one too. :)>
56:<Here are answers to a few of your questions...

1 --  "Technical Support" -- This topic is there, maybe you have to scroll down?  See http://i.imgur.com/3qetR55.png.

2 -- "same list of topics" -- That would be a bug, I'll look into that

3 -- "comments not in chronological order.  I'm not seeing this.  But I did add a backend index this morning to improve performance, maybe this fixed this bug as a side effect?  That'd be lucky. :)

4 --  "email notifications of comments on forum posts" -- edx is building this as we speak.  Don't have an ETA though.

5 -- all discussions on which you've commented -- I believe that page exists, but is broken now (you raised that separately).  We'll debug that.

6 -- more metadata on discussions -- I'll pass this along to the forums core team.  My engineering team here at Stanford doesn't work in this software much (yet).

Thanks for taking the time to give all this good feedback.

- <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> (engineering team)>
57:<you've probably already found it by now.  :) good job!>
58:<No flats in the key of Dsharp. :) I just kept going along...and eventually got a message and it all worked out.>
59:<Hi Sotiris.  So nice to meet you.  My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> and I teach 9 and 10 year olds in Utah.  I have a son in Italy who is a missionary.  While he is learning Italian, I am learning International Maths. :)  This course will be great for all of us.  I am grateful for the opportunity. Happy day to you.>
60:<thank you :)  Who do you bless with your teaching?>
61:<Thank you for sharing, Lara.  My livelihood lies in public education, but my sister-in-law home schools. I commend you and her.  I am grateful for many different paths. Also many different maths paths..ha ha. You remind me to share what I learn with her as well as work colleagues.  :)>
62:<*laugh*  Yes, your worst fears confirmed :)

You can't follow your messages?  I've been able to follow a discussion (by clicking on the star at the top-right corner of the screen)... I can't follow a specific response (to see if anyone has commented back to me specifically) but I can see if anyone has added to the thread generally.  If that's not working, feel free to submit it as #10 below!>
63:<It seems to have been resolved now :)>
64:<Well, hoping that I'm wrong, but it seems like a quiet month is not happening :)>
65:<Loved this comment, by the way ;)>
66:<Mike: Beth here, I know that feeding your family is a good thing but, trust me, student teaching is a gift. I became a science teacher after careers in other things and I learned soooooo much from my cooperating teacher that I wouldn't trade it for the world. Most of what I learned from my teacher had nothing to do with content and everything to do with avoiding pitfalls I'd never have thought of without her help. Find a way to accept the gift that student teaching is.Everything is figure outable. I hope you can figure it out. :)>
67:<or... don't send that kind of work home.  keep it where you can have control of it.  :)>
68:<I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference this would make in my ability to participate in discussions (at least, discussions about something other than bugs :)

In addition, it would be helpful if there was an easy way to identify not just which responses are new but which comments are new (since comments are interspersed throughout the discussion, attached to the response they relate to).>
69:<Sherri- Watch the video about. At the end of the video she asked a question with four choices. Hope this help :-)>
70:<Wow, well done on the giant font!  :)  No worries...>
71:<Melissa, please do not let your professors discourage you. We need you! We need enthusiastic teachers who are open to trying to teach in a different way. You are the future. :-)>
72:<Hey all,  
I'm a computer programmer from Israel - actually thinking of a career-change towards scientific education (for high-schoolers).  

Nice meeting you all,  
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, Tel-Aviv, Israel :)>
73:<As an elementary teacher it is hard for for me to watch a student make a mistake. You want them to get it right off the bat, if they don't I know I feel like I didn't do my job right the first time. I can see though how children can grow and learn from their mistakes. As most of parents have probably told us tons of times growing up please learn from my mistakes, well if we all learned from our mistakes instead of theirs we would all be so much smarter. :)  From now on Im not going to feel bad when they do make that mistake, I'll just look at it as a brain growing.>
74:<Hi. I am a grade 7 teacher in Ontario, Canada. I have noticed that there are such a wide range of groups present in this course from all different parts of the world. If there is any Grade 7 teacher who would like to become student penpals with my class and exchange information to learn about somewhere else in the world, I would be most interested.

On a different note - I am looking forward to learning more about engaging my students in the fun world of math through different methods of teaching and hopefully sharing ideas with everyone here:)>
75:<Hello! Namastey!
I am a software engineer by profession. Me and my colleagues have been volunteering together for an NGO. After work, we go and teach the underprivileged children (Grade K to 5) in the nearby slum area.
While trying to teach them mathematics I came across various challenges and this is the reason I have enrolled for this course.
I want to learn new ways in which I can teach maths to them effectively.

Looking forward to a better future. :)>

78:<Me too! As research changes these things can happen. This class is forcing me to really think about what comes out of my mouth. I am, after all, only human! ;)>
79:<I think you're right :)>
80:<Jumping in here... keep in mind the words "perhaps" -- as in, probably not... and "very specific LD" -- as in, most of the LDs out there *won't* preclude it. 
    I have a nephew with severe dysgraphia who's also pretty gifted in math - uses Efofex to get those problems down and yes, they have to battle with the schools sometimes... and I've had some years teaching folks with LDs, including at a small school with a visiting expert from the UK who wrote books about dyslexia and math... it's totally possible to raise a Math success :) (Warning:  most materials, esp. online, aren't particularly helpful, though...) I'd be glad to share resources  (I've got a few things on my site at www.resourceroom.net that I put there 'cause I didn't want them in a drawer, and I write in a blog at http://resourceroomblog.wordpress.com )>
81:<S0me free advice (probably worth every penny ;)) -- I'd suggest taking it slowly... *and* doing as much hands-on and concrete.   Have you seen David Berg's materials/approach?   (His actual training is lengthy and expensive, but I learned a lot just from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kJRyMC5HGs  and some of the other videos he has online).   So I would use a *lot* of pennies for practicing dividing.  Some of the free exercises at the dreambox.com website are also a lot of fun and low-stress, and might give you other ideas.   (I'm not trying to sell anything -- just share ideas that *might* help).   
     I am longing to make a game about the "cloak of divisibility" ... so I'd better get back to my drawing board... tearing self away...>
82:<Thanks Mylene - once again you have illuminated the issue magnificently!  :)>
83:<A lot of the negative ideas and feelings about math do come from hearing other adults and peers. Yes what the media displayed on tv shows and movies does play a factor, but I think their personal in the classroom is the main cause of the phobia. If students are ONLY pushed to memorized and to complete worksheets after worksheets and not taught or allowed to apply and extend what they know then they will not see the relevance of learning the classroom math and how it's important to everyday life math. I apologize for such a long sentence at the end. You get the gist, just a little passionate about math. :)>

85:<Interesting point about procedural teaching. I'm a language teacher and this seems to me like an analogy to teaching grammar and vocab in isolation vs presenting it to  students in a context (the latter being the more 'modern' approach). 

I find that some learners like to have grammar structures explained to them, others prefer to 'intuit' the meaning of the grammatical forms from a text/video etc. When you say 'procedural', do you mean something analogous to the 'grammar only' approach, where there is nothing to stimulate the students who learn better by intuition and seeing how the concepts work in context?

Sorry if I've overloaded this with language-teaching buzzwords! I hope my question to you is relatively clear nonetheless. :)>
86:<Hi Dan!  I too will be teaching in NOVA and plan to experiment with "flipping" my classroom in the fall - not going fully flipped until I am feeling confident.  Thanks for the info RE: Twitter,going follow:-)>

88:<I came across the concept of Productive Failure in 2010 at a symposium where Manu Kapur [http://www.icce2010.upm.edu.my/slides/ICCE_2010_ManuKapur.pdf][1] presented this very interesting concept about designing lessons for failure in order to maximize exploration and discussion (a very brief summary - there's a bit more to it). read more here: [http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=Productive+failure&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=_R3nUfL0GOSwiQfThIG4Cw&ved=0CCwQgQMwAA][2]

89:<If you're using an iPad, the Puffin browser works well. :)>
90:<I think students have been misguided about math. People say only smart kids can do math and saying this to a child you are setting him/her up for failure. I have a middle school daughter (8th grade) who hates math. She was going to take the California Mathematics State Exam and told me "I am going to score far below basic." It took me two weeks to break down the math and explain it to her. Long story short, she scored proficient on the state exam :) ! She gained confidence afterwards.>
91:<That sounds like a good plan! I work at the high school level and it is so important that math students have the courage to attempt a problem...fear of making a mistake can be immobilizing. It is true outside of the classroom too, as adults we need to tackle numerous problems that involve math. 
I can see you will now encourage your students' brains to grow. :)>
92:<I actually posted to FB today mentioning that commiserating with you child by saying you are not good at math either is not really an effective bonding experience and that studies show they will do worse than if you approach math with interest and anticipation of the excitement in learning along with your child.  - 4 young mothers thanked me  :)>
93:<As a kid, I struggled with math conceptually as well as forumlaically (I'm making that word up to describe that I lacked skill in math procedures -mostly due to a need for memorization of numbers).  Math didn't "click" for me until I was learning how to teach it in my teacher prep program in college.  But when it did...WOW!  As a teacher, it became really important to me to help my students approach math without fear and with excitement -I just knew that in order to learn, they needed to be engaged with their hearts.  My mom's favorite story is how she told my former high school math tutor that I LOVE to teach math and the look of shock on my tutor's face.  Hey, if I could learn algebra...anyone can!  It's been a sort of quest of mine to bring the wonder of math to my own children as well as the learners I work with.  I've been an educator in the US for over 20 years -public school, private school and most recently, home schooling my own two kiddos (6th and 8th grades this year). So...that's my background and what I'll base my answers on.  

I think that two factors are key to the question here - teaching methods and lack of foundational skills.  I think that traditional "top down" teaching methods are problematic.  We tend to teach math as linear (it's often not), overly formulaic (it's sometimes not or not necessary) and we come at it as if the key to math is in the rote memorization of facts and figures.  In fact, mathematics is ART.  Mathematics should be DISCOVERED, not directed -especially in the early years when kids are forming their perceptions and training their brains.  I also think that a lack of foundational skills can shake an already rocky self-perception of mathematical ability.  I'm not advocating for skill drills, though.  When I talk about lack of foundational skills, I'm really saying that people lack an understanding of concept, patterns, flow.  If kids learned to SEE math, rather than memorize math, they would have the foundational skills they need later on to actually build the skills.

Joyful learning :)>
94:<This turns out to be a bug technical staff are working on fixing now (for details please see the post above).  Hang in there :)>

96:<The tab next to this video on the top will show you the page of survey. :)
enjoy it>
97:<I think I had the same problem- but when I clicked "submit" (instead of "check" which wasn't there :-)  It worked.

98:<The most damaging negative messages about math that stay with us are ones from our own parents and family members. Comments that excuse students from trying because it is just too hard for them: Smother love: Sympathy and protection from real life math experiences because they are just too young to have to do deal with money exchanges on their own: Laughter, ridicule  and derision in the guise of "I was just joking!" after a negative comment such as "It's easy . Just do it." or a quick snide remark in passing like "Dummy!" by a much admired big brother. 

PEER Pressure: It is very popular to say  "I hate Math!" with no specific reasons to support the statement except that it is the "cool" thing to say to be in the 'in group' crowd:Put downs by both the students who consider themselves superior, and the ones who just like being verbal bullies: Fear of being wrong publicly and admitting that you do not get it: Fear of asking for help.

Teachers: By grouping in ability levels:  by using comments in the classroom that are  heard and interpreted as negative; and the greatest damage is done by using the word "Fail" and the letter "F on graded assignments!>
99:<I am excited to be a part of this online community.  Thank you to Jo and guests for offering a course during the summer months.  I look forward to facing my challenges with math (and helping my kids through math homework) head on. After completing the survey, I can tell already I will be exposed to new ideas and thinking about math.  :)
Welcome to everyone in the group.>
100:<Hello,
This is my first online course. Doing it because I want to learn some new ideas/ skills when my boy goes to preschool. =)>
101:<I think we are all guilty of this.  I think of the times when my children were learning to tie their shoes.  Sometimes it as just easier if I tied their shoes:)>
102:<I know what you mean about the knit stitch!  Ripping out work certainly burns a new synapse into my brain :)  I agree that parents expectations can be unreasonable, only accepting 100%.  There is a great deal of difference between high expectations and demanding perfection.  It is good to know you are helping your brain, and helping your students' brains.  You do important work!>
103:<Please don't take ALL the blame when students do poorly. They are responsible for asking questions and being a participant in the learning process. :)>
104:<I agree that the information (that mistakes are learning opportunities that directly lead to brain growth and to enhanced learning) is important and should be shared with educators and students.  But I don't understand your point that  making mistakes is currently experienced as a very bad thing and whether that taken into account in the research.  Yes, many kids experience mistakes this way.  Those with a fixed mindset take it as evidence that they are not capable.  However, those with a growth mindset just keep plugging a long.  So the fact that some students find mistakes excruciating is part of the problem - their fixed mindset is limiting the learning opportunity in that moment of error. The research encompasses this sad paradox.  The mistake itself is neutral.  What the student (or teacher) does with it -- that's what matters.  I like your lead in sentence to your essay. It made me laugh.  :-)>
105:<Hello, I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>. I teach physics in high school,in Bandar Lampung - Indonesia. I hope to meet many of you through posts and share ideas about math for increace my khowledge.
I thank you. :-)>
106:<You are not doing anything wrong :)  It seems that the incomplete progress report has to do with peer graded responses that (apparently) have not been graded yet.  Once those have been graded, that should add to your overall score.  You can track your work that requres peer assessment using the Assessment Panel tab at the top.
I am not sure about the survey; hope the technical staff will look into this.>
107:<I would give you 10 votes for this post if I could :)>
108:<Well, I really liked the way discussions were organized in CS50x on edx.  It actually worked.  Thankfully, the search feature works fine here, but clicking on the different areas of the dropdown tab seems to return all kinds of discussions when I go to, say, Technical Support.  Of course, it also depends on how disciplined the students in the course are about posting in the right place, otherwise try as you might, all kinds of discussions will appear all over the place :)>
109:<I've now got it open.  I tried a different computer.  :)>
110:<what a great video!  Thank you for the link.  :)>
111:<I did only two lecture style classes in my grade 9 math class this year and dealt with two months of complaining. BUT, my overall class median on the exam was the highest of any of the other 6 sections - you have to be stubborn and have support from the school leadership - which is me, so parents didn't get anywhere. :)>
112:<Good question!  I have no idea but I feel better knowing that I'm not alone!  :)>
113:<I was a math major in college and went to one of my professors for help. He said, "I wouldn't worry about this if I were you. I think you're doing fine. To tell you the truth I don't expect as much from my female students as I do my male students." I was determined to prove him wrong. I made the 2nd highest grade in the class on the final.:)>
114:<Completed session1 (2 hours) and there is NO work saved. Progress says 0/8. Assessment panel says I have NO work submitted. Scrolled through bar under the course and there is none of my writing saved!! HELP :) I am using CHROME. Do i need to do session 1 over again?>
115:<Simple- overall it appears to be a cultural problem. We allow ourselves as adults and even as young children think that it's o.k. not to be "good at math." You hear excusable phrases like "I don't do math," or "math doesn't run in my family" all the time. We don't think twice thus the heavily relied belief that math is inherently innate. Similarly, we usually wouldn't say "I can't read" even if we weren't great readers. Asian countries believe innate ability is mostly hard work. American's believe split between DNA and how you apply yourself. But wait...is there also still a gender stereotype that boys are better at math? It has been suggested that effective teaching can help but we must also look at "the belief systems that influence children’s motivation." 

However, I still agree that we as teachers need to teach many different methods of math. As a child I loved math, but was never taught how to use math in the real world setting. I mean do you really see people today breaking out their pen and pencil to find the average price of their favorite Miss Me jeans after a 33% sale?  Problem solving was complete the even or odd numbered set of questions (which ever didn't have the solutions) in the back of the text for homework after watching the teacher/ students practice on the board. I didn't learn relevant "mental" problem solving until I was out of college and started my own life!! Why did I have to discover this on my own so late? Isn't life all about problem solving? I also believe part of the solution (at least at the elementary level) is an inquiry or self discovery based approach, not always giving the answers upfront. Teaching math must provide many relevant, manipulative experiences in which students may connect to a myriad of possibilities. Why does math have to be daunting? It should be FUN! :) <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
116:<Thank you fahrenba --- I was getting frustrated when the blog would not log!  :) Thanks again.>
117:<Do y'all use some sort of positive behavior incentives to reward students for good attendance or proper behavior?  We do at our school, and it seems to encourage some of them to strive to meet our expectations.  Of course, the ultimate goal is for them to do these things based on intrinsic motivation rather than external motivation, but we've got to start somewhere! :)>
118:<I still remember the anxiety I experienced in the third grade when my teacher gave us flash card tests on basic math facts (and I am in my 50's!). I've always been fairly good in math, but hate being timed or rushed. It seems as though those flash cards would go up and down faster than I could read them, much less jot down what I was instructed to write (I also wore glasses and had trouble seeing, so that may have been part of the problem) - I don't remember if we were supposed to copy the problems or just write down our answers. I just remember the sick feeling I would get in the pit of my stomach! That's one reason why I hate "timed tests" of any kind for my students! I don't want them to experience anxiety related to math because they are fearful of the time constraints! Unfortunately, we are required by higher authorities to provide them with testing situations similar to standardized tests so that they will develop test-taking skills to help them score the best they can. :( That's one dilemma I'm hoping to resolve during this course! :)>
119:<Thanks! It finally started to load when I clicked on the Google Cache link! Solved that problem. :)>
120:<In longer 90-minute blocks, students are expected to learn two days' worth of content in one class period. Oftentimes, students cannot follow (much less understand) content from the second half of the class because they have not had time to process and practice the first half of the lesson.  I experienced that when taking a 3-hour college algebra course once a week! All I did the last hour or so of class was to copy everything the teacher wrote on the board - I could barely follow what she was doing at that point in time.  Each Sunday afternoon, I'd spend hours trying to make sense of my notes and sample problems.  Most high school sophomores will not have that kind of self-discipline! Any suggestions?  Hoping to figure out the best way for handling this situation during this course, too! :)>
121:<This is an interesting thought.  I was a high achieving girl with a fixed mindset and I've always believed that I was born with the ability and didn't make any effort to achieve high marks.  I would swear to you that this is true!  

Now maybe I'll have to go and question my subconscious self :-)>
122:<This happened to me as well.  I had to resubmit the answers awhile later, but when I looked at the progress page, it showed that the answers were recorded.  Have a look at your progress page - if it shows you have completed the tasks, they have been saved after all :)>
123:<available at http://code.edx.org/, but will likely require a few programmers to work on it :)>
124:<I have the same situation, at least now I know I am not alone....:)...I will wait for a while to see what is going on....>
125:<I read your post since I was right below you :)  Sounds like an interesting book and I will check out your blog.>
126:<Love this idea.  I hope I can use it too.  We might make it instead.  I'm cheap :)>
127:<My brother lives in Heber. I love Park City. :)>
128:<Makes me think of one trig student I had that used to be frustrated but kept trying.  One (of many) days she was in getting help and then started to cry.  I very calmly said "you can go this" and after a moment, she started again.  The end result is she finished the course with an A and a B and was extremely thrilled.  Me too.  :)>
129:<I agree with JulieWebb - thank you for your service.  My husband was Air Force, too. :-)>
130:<That's true, if there was an option to add image, just like on this discussion board, it would make our work much easier.  This suggestion is worth emailing to technical staff :)>
131:<Hi everyone, 

Since this course is built on (virtually) the same platform as edX, the edX Demo 101 course they are offering now might be of help with our experiences here. Please see if you find it useful :)

It's a shame they did not have this course before I took my first course on edX, I had to learn the hard way :)>

133:<Check out assessment panel - problems you have submitted.  If they have "Waiting to be graded" next to them, they might not have been graded yet.  Otherwise I guess that's the place we should eventually see the feedback :)>
134:<It is likely the survey :)>
135:<If it says Thank you for your response, that means your answer has been accepted and saved :)>
136:<Yes.  The problem is, where do I click on my own username?  I have to browse through to a discussion where I have commented, use CTRL-F to find my username, then click on it!  It would be great if it was shown on my "dashboard," i.e. when I click on my own name in the top right corner of the screen. If there's a more direct route, let me know :)>
137:<No worries :)  And thank you for the screencasts you have made!  They are extremely helpful with the specific issues students are facing in this course.>
138:<This is a great idea!  However, I would not do it in front of my second graders - I have a feeling they would never forgive me if I did :)
I see how middle school students might benefit from this experience!>
139:<Your computer might have been unplugged :)

You will see a link  like this under each video in this course - really helpful in case you have difficulties streaming them.>
140:<The message I really hope to convey to the folks in the fall's pre-pre-algebra for adults class is that I hope they'll be willing to set aside the negatives and the worries about How [insert adjective here] They Seem/Are and trust that we've got some new ideas that will help them understand numbers, *not* just survive a math class. 
    Some will be aware of the power of the negative stuff in their minds; others won't, I am sure... but many will have, as their agenda, to survive without risking or engaging.  Going to try to figure out how to  get their minds thinking about numbers... maybe before they realize it ;) 
... so I guess the message is "It's worth trusting and trying one more time...">
141:<I just really wish I could swipe it so that my students could follow this format in the math class in the fall :)>
142:<I am so glad to hear you did this :)  I have had a similar experience although unfortunately it was not with a child I had in class.  I see the potential in this child and tell him every chance I get and it hurt to see him struggle through school because everyone just thought of him as the bad kid.  I am hopeful for his future as he enters high school and always make myself available if he needs or take the opportunity to talk to him when I can.  I wish that more teachers would see how damaging it is to a child to stick that label on them and just give up on them.>
143:<I start the year by showing kids the following video on mindsets:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhLJPhxuvGM

Then I show them this video on Famous Failures:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT4Fu-XDygw

We then use our class discussion forum to discuss what it failure means and how mindset affects how we deal with failure. I end up asking if failure is a bad thing or a good thing and why.>
144:<I think this is!  At least I hope so :)>
145:<Happy to help if I can.  If you're ever looking for extra beta testers or TAs, let me know! :)>
146:<We are all in this together, so mistakes are part of the learning process. Mistakes not only help us learn what we have done wrong, they help us learn what we need to do next. All this while our brains keep getting bigger! 

Mistakes=synapses=different outcome=bigger brain! COOL!>
147:<Perpetual Pursuit of Perseverance and Perfection

I want to teach my students to embrace the mistakes, and see through the mistakes as a means to grow and learn. I will definitely inform the students that the brain learns more from a mistake, pointing out more synapses are formed more through the mistakes than through getting something right the first time. I really like the idea of actually having 5 students put work on the board, and telling them that at least one of them should intentionally make a mistake. This allows the struggling student to feel less afraid of making a mistake. Once all 5 problems are worked out on the board, I discuss with the class the work and ask them to find where the mistakes are (either deliberate, or accidental). 

One other mini-lesson I may add to my curriculum is a weekly highlight of a mistake that led to something snazzy.

148:<Good question!  I've been wondering that myself.  I suppose there are two options: if the instructional team is really evil, they will let us fail. :)  If they are not evil, they will grade them themselves. ;)  Or maybe recruit some of us to do a few above and beyond our required 3.  

If this is like other MOOCs, I suspect that by the 3rd or 4th week, the giant influx of registrants who try the first task or two will have dwindled down to a small number of people who finish all the tasks... which should cut down on the peer grading that needs to be done.  Just speculating though!>
149:<I LOVE this idea....and will use a version of it with my on- line students....as a way to get to know them, to spark discussions.... and to segway into doing SOME Math :)>

153:<Hello everyone... This is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Singapore but I had never learnt Math using the Singapore model method ;P. Algebra and calculus seem like histories to me (although I managed to do pretty well in school then), now that they do not have direct usage in my area of work. However, I am sure Math has helped in my sense of proportion in design. 
I am also a mum to a 2 children in a Montessori Preschool.
Hope to learn and kindle the interest in Math for my lovely 2. This course is an eye-opener, provides different perspectives in introducing Math.

155:<At the NCTM conference a few years ago, I went to a talk by a woman named Mary Pat Sjostrom who was doing research on teaching persistence.  She had some wonderful problems and a great protocol for having kids reflect on their attempts and write about it.  She also showed this great video of an interview with Andrew Wiles(the Fermat's last theorem guy from Princeton) http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CPRnUPH8sME - my students actually could relate to his persistence and the feeling of the breakthrough that he made.  It was really emotional for them to watch him talk about it.

156:<You have probably all heard, "We learn from our mistakes."  Well this is really true, especially in Math.  Did you know that when you make a mistake in Math and work through it your brain GROWS?  This year, let's make mistakes and really grow our Math brains! :)>
157:<Just answered my own question about this!  The scholarly reference is:

158:<I love how she puts value on their mistakes.  I've always been a fan of students explaining their reasoning to the class, whether right or wrong.  In fact, in my class, we love mistakes and sometimes students win prizes for the best mistakes :)  In addition, a common question in our class is "What do you think some of the big mistakes are that others may make?">
159:<I have "peer graded" for each of the 4 sessions but have not had any of my own graded - seems like the 3 days estimated time is really quite low -- but then maybe we are we in the experimental group to see if we persevere in our performances without our rewards?  or am open-ended mathematical problem, if 5000 problems are submitted and those actually grading/reviewing do 3, are we reviewing fresh problems, recycling just a few, or blame it on technology glitches of endless loops ... need to get some sleep to rest my growing brain :)>
160:<I visualised the cases rising from the bottom, with a broader base being introduced each time to "support" the cases above it. From this point of view, I didn't see the now quite obvious (n squared + <zipRedac>) formula, but because I was focused on the added "base", I saw each new base simply as 2n + <zipRedac>, which then needed to be added to the previous case to determine the current case. I then copied the formulas down to row <zipRedac>00 in Excel, where (2 x <zipRedac>00) + <zipRedac> + <zipRedac>0000 (the 99th case) = <zipRedac>020<zipRedac>. In hindsight it seems a bit convoluted, but I suppose it illustrates how there are different methods (and tools) one can use to solve a problem . . . liked this one! ;)>
161:<Hi Katrien, 

I have just been preparing a training session which features this. Try this example (practically). Draw a rectangle and divide in half using a line from top to bottom. Now divide the left side into quarters using two diagonal lines and the right hand side into quarters using a vertical line and a horizontal line. You have now divided your shape into eighths which are all equal in size but not in shape. Hope this helps :)

Best wishes, <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
162:<Hi,
I am midway through section 4 and none of my peer-evaluated responses for any of the sections have been graded yet.  I realize mine are in a pool of others' responses and it probably is a matter of needing enough participants to complete their 3 peer evaluations for everyone's to be "graded".  Hmmmm, there's probably an growth-mindset math question looming in there...hehe.  I guess my question is what if some of our responses don't get graded?  That will affect our overall progress despite the fact that we did indeed complete everything.  Just wondering!  :)>
163:<Loved the title!  Haha...I am an engineer, also a math teacher ( my second career, after 16 years being engineer, I became a high school math teacher in Ontario Canada). I also have a child who doesn't think math is her thing. I have a daughter who is going to be 19 in few weeks. 

I love math with passion for almost what I can remember...:)  Don't know why, maybe born with it, or maybe my parents. I am Chinese Canadian. Born and raised in China and came to Canada in my middle 20th. I hoped that Math will also come easy to my daughter but didn't happen. She is the second year university student and study at engineering school for science. Her math basic skill are not strong as I hoped, her grade 6, 7, & 8 math teachers were not math person, they were Phy. teacher and taught her a lot wrong stuff, I tried to re-teach her, but you can image, you cannot teach your own kids! I am very disappointed with our system that you don't have to be a qualified math teacher to teach math! If teacher doesn't have passion with Math, I don't see how you can make kids to have passion with Math!!!!>
164:<Thanks for the HTML hints - those will come in handy when submitting my next set of answers :)>
165:<Definitely! How does a bay learn to walk if he or she doesn't fall down! :)>
166:<"And importantly, don't share with them your own painful experiences of math in
school if you had those. Research has found that as soon as
mothers told their daughters that they were bad at maths in school, which
mothers often say to help their daughters feel better, their daughters achievement"

I think we can be frank with our pasts and I think it normalizes not being perfect.
I often share my engineering school experiences because students and parents often think that if you are good at Math it means you never got anything wrong!
So what was your lowest score ever?
For me it was a 7!!!!  out of 100
TWICE in engineering school
Once was freshman yr in mult choice physics where they cacl your score like the SAT (so one of my friends got a -5!!!) and the second 7 was sr year in Communications System Design
Sharing these experiences helps students to see that no one is perfect :)

PS The race commentator would focus on who had the faster rate (steeper slope) and that one of them stopped for a while>
167:<Hey guys,

I'm afraid I just got here, and very new to this platform. Just wanted to ask a question here because I know you guys will get to me faster :-)

Is it too late to start this class, in terms of receiving a certificate? Have I missed any assignment deadlines already? Should I proceed to just audit the course?

Thanks so much, I appreciate your time.

168:<I really like your idea. I am wishing I had a Coke, chips, and chocolate chip cookies now. :) In this world of instant gratification and data at our fingertips, students <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>at learning the same way. They think it should come easily and instantly. They need to learn about perseverance. I think of Thomas Edison and Abraham Lincoln as great examples if you want to get your Science and Social Studies teachers involved.>
169:<Yay! I have always wanted to say that to a parent as well. :)>
170:<I think that is a great plan! I picture the little first graders looking at you wide eyed when you tell them that you grew your brain over the summer! :)>
171:<Middle Grades  :)>
172:<I guess the purpose is twofold.  When you vote, you (a) express agreement with the post (like it) and (b) comment on how helpful it was.
So, this feature is useful to avoid lengthy "me too" threads :)>
173:<Very true :)>
174:<Looking on the bright side, this is an opportunity for students to make lots of mistakes, thus growing both in their independent thinking and their language skills :))  By the way, this activity is an excellent way of learning to read graphs.>
175:<I do believe this was the mistake of whoever transcribes her conversation for hearing-impaired participants. If you notice the running commentary along the side, my thought is whoever was typing/scribing while she was speaking mistook her saying "Common Core" for "Common Call" with her accent. We can't assume the person transcribing is a "mathie" like us who knows the vernacular :)>
176:<I like that! :-)>
177:<mine is missing too - saw it earlier in the day - maybe they released it too early or tweaking it some more :)>
178:<that makes sense :)>
179:<It has been a practice in my district (for a very long time - so there is a real community expectation and culture established) to begin identifying students at the end of third grade for "accelerated math" where they will be placed in a curriculum that compacts the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade standards into two years. As the  standards have gotten more rigorous some are beginning to question the practice, but more from the stance that we don't have enough students that we feel can truly accelerate.  I think all the research that has been shared may be able to help us break through this long standing practice! :)  I liked Dr. Boaler's point that when you have truly mixed groups teachers will see a need to differentiate.  Teachers who teach the accelerated group or honors level students in middle and high school often see no need to differentiate.
**Question** - I am curious about students who are identified as gifted - is research also showing that they benefit by being in mixed ability classes?  We have a center-based gifted program that begins in third grade where students from several schools come together for all of their instruction.  (Kind of a magnet school within a school)>
180:<I had this same experience.  I remember it most when I was in junior high school math class and we were doing so pre-algebra work.  I asked my teacher why we were doing something and he said very clearly to me in front of the class, "You need to quit thinking about this so much.  Just do what I'm doing and it will work out."   Hm....  I had always thought that math should make sense and there should be a reason why you were doing what you were doing.  Silly me.  I checked out of math at that point and only took math for one more year.  Why waste time doing something that had no purpose and the teacher couldn't even explain why.  :-)>
181:<I love it! I may use it in my own classroom :)>
182:<I hope this is the "forum" where our answers are supposed to go! ;)

As for the message I will give to my students and the beginning of the year and the message I will continue to reiterate all year long, it will be:

"I can grow my math brain.  Effort makes us smarter and mistakes are important parts of learning.">
183:<@ MathSuperHero O_O  Did you have to pay to get in? :D>
184:<ha!  Gentle with your remarks there, some students might think you are serious :D>
185:<Let's see if we are on the same page here. (Literally as well as figuratively speaking :D)  Would you specify which 2 problems you meant?
Also, if the problem persists, you might want to email the tech support team at techsupport@class.stanford.edu>
186:<To help them put their guard down, I would regularly share with my class my own mistakes, even those not having to do with math:driving, cooking, gardening...topics they can completely relate to.  I'd share with the class my own learning process of getting to where I am today.  I'm afraid that high school students are very worried about fitting in and being made fun of.  I think we have to set the example that we all make mistakes and learn from them.  It cannot be a singular message on day one.  It has to be a continual way of life throughout the school year (calendar year!)>

188:<Glad it worked for you :)>
189:<Ready and waiting whenever you are!  :)  This has been very insightful! Thank you!>
190:<... yup, this is a toughie! 

I'll be collaborating this fall in a pre-pre-algebra course... word problems are a honking big deal. THey've had years and years of, when they *had* to do 'em, saying "okay, what math was in this section?  Let's find the numbers, do that math to it and put that down."  Usually that works for half of 'em, and no quiz is ever all word problems, so ... they can pass.
    Welcome to college.
    
    We'll start with reading a problem wiht the answers in it, and making a number sentence from it.  To wit:

The perimeter of a triangle is the distance around it.   THis triangle's sides are 4, 8, and 9 centimeters.   Its perimeter is 21 centimeters.

Draw that out and write a number sentence to say what's happening there.   (I may throw in irrelevant numbers at some point... but building confidence is my priority.)  
................... once they've got this little guy under their collective belts...

Okay, what if something changes?   What could you change in that triangle?
(make it visual -- lots of these folks are not focused on remembering what perimeter is; just how to get the math problem right.) 

If this side is (shorter, longer, whatever)... what happens to the perimeter?   (show the walk around...)  Does it make sense?   How does it make sense?   (connect the language and the visual and the numbers in the brain...) 
 
Can you make a new number sentence -- that is still true?   
If it's not true, why?   Let's figure it out. 
Okay... have fun with this... draw for me... try some different changes.   Let's make some more number sentences.  Get together with your buddy and see what you can come up with.  Impress me!   

Then let's talk about which things worked... and which things didn't... and why... 

We could also do a problem with something like traveling down a road, which we would draw, and we'd ride our first leg, which is in Mahomet 11 miles, and then to Monticello, which is another 17 miles, for our grand total of 38 miles.   We can make a number sentence out of that... and then do the same "make changes" process (if you take a longer route or find a short cut ;)). 

Then if we get *really* daring, I can say:  "Hey.  What if I changed the perspective.   We're *in* Mahomet.    We've done 11 miles.  It's 17 miles from here to Monticello, for a total of 38 miles.  Can we make a number sentence that *doesn't* have adding?   Can it still make sense?  What question would we be answering?>
191:<... I answered the "make a new problem with a growth mindset" in the comments section... sent it... then realized I hadn't "copied" it to paste to submit, and i ended up submitting somethign so I could move on until I could find my "comment" and copy and paste it...
   ... and now it will be one of those answers that can actually get a 0 :)   Is there a way to reset?>
192:<F.A.I.L. = First Attempt In Learning
:)>
193:<The "because" answers don't even make sense to me... and this is about a whole lot more than "proportional relationships".  I'd  make sure the kiddos understood proportions first ;)   I'd be all over the manipulatives, with a focus on how they show that proportionality; maybe try to find a way to show the same thing with different sized cylinders (so it was the relationship, not the gross amount that mattered).>
194:<:-)>
195:<I teach several courses with students who have IEP's. When I first started teaching, I bought into the misconception that Special Ed students cannot be proficient math learners.  However, I have been happily proven wrong again and again over the last twenty years.  What I have discovered is that students with IEP's can and do learn math when their math teachers learn how to teach.  I'm still learning. :)>
196:<I had that problem when using Internet explorer, but I changed to Chrome and then it worked :-)>
197:<Hi Darleen806,

I'm just a student in this unit, like yourself. I emailed the tech guys about the problem with the 1st session tasks not all showing up as complete. I received a reply saying that they know about the issue and are working on it.

I'm not sure how to watch posts either, so I can't help you there. Hopefully you'll find my response here :)

The work for peer review isn't sent to you exactly, you have to go to the tab above called "Assessment Panel" then you will be able to take a tutorial on how to peer review other people's work and then it will let you start peer reviewing.

I've reviewed 3-4 peoples work for each of the first 3 peer review tasks, but have not received any peer reviews on my own work yet. I assume there are a lot of people struggling to understand how to use the technology in this course, which is kind of unfortunate.

Cheers, <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
198:<Love to tweet:)
 
@PenDeskLLC>
199:<Sounds like they will be back up early next week (just saw the note in the Course Info tab).  Should be interesting to see if work done in those sections is still there :)>
200:<I say this to my students as well :-D>
201:<Patience is a virtue. Give them a chance to iron out the bugs. You can always ask for your money back :)>
202:<Patience is a virtue. Give them a chance to iron out the bugs. You can always ask for your money back :)>
203:<Love it, too! Already planning my "Favorite Numbers" slideshow for the beginning of school :)>
204:<I wonder how this would work.  We do the standard test (untimed and ungraded, of course), and then we gather up all of the tests, and then we find all of the mistakes that were made because of using an ineffective approach (skip over the ones that were simple arithmetic errors).  We make a new test, asking the students why the given answer is wrong.  It would be hard to do this with elementary arithmetic, but it could work for more complex problems.

The student would be asked to identify what was done to lead to the wrong answer, and then present a different approach (which can be a simple modification or an entirely new approach) that answers the question correctly.  This second part would be what they are graded on, not the first.  Credit would be given for a good idea that's still wrong.

I'm not certain if we would need to give each question to the student who made the mistake, but this approach would have the added effect that we don't waste time on areas that the students already know.

We can take it a step further.  We take the original test, find all of the questions that everyone got right, and we replace those with harder questions.  Then we start from the beginning with the new modified test.

Just an idea.  Maybe I, ahem, made a mistake . . .  :)>
205:<Guys, you are allowed to peer review more than just the minimum 3 times per peer review question (I know everyone is really busy). I'm still waiting on any feedback on my submissions. I think the reason the minimum number was 3 was to take into account the people who may not complete the course, so at least people should receive 1 peer review per submission.
Hopefully most people who are still taking the unit have figured out how to start the peer review process. :)>
206:<Yes, I agree. I only can assume that they are working on session 5, 6, 7, 8 and maybe by mistake they posted session 5, 6, then by correct this error they took it away...When anybody in the rush, more chance to make mistakes...Remember, mistakes make brain grow...:)>
207:<I definitely see myself sitting on the fence for this subject. There are times when I tell them keep going what are you ideas, what do you need to know to try to guide them with questioning rather than constant drill and practice.  I do do some drill and practice but not always, I do try to balance. I think the appreciate the balance. Initially they definitely want step by step and play the I can't do it. But the more I question and they know I'm not giving the. The steps or the answers, the persevere. 

The interesting thing I have found is that my partner is straight drill and practice. There's one way only. I am a multitude of trials in various ways, group, pairs independent as I know we all learn differently. 

This summer however a few parents and students see that I am the easy teacher for the lower achieving students and my teaching partner is for the academic students. 

How do we make them see that different or working with change is good, and understanding the concepts and being able to explain them is beneficial and really high level of thinking than just knowing this then this then this. 

Maybe a little ramble in there but non the less :)>
208:<I talk to my 2nd graders all the time about mistakes, starting on the first day.  And then I proceed to make them!  ;)>
209:<Good idea! Thanks :)>
210:<That problem really made me think, this is one area in math that once I figure out the relationship in the pattern I can usually figure it out, but this problem, I ended up approaching several different ways until I saw what was happening and then was able to make sense of it. This is something I want to be able to do with my students to give them that permission to spend time and figure it out, instead of we have this many problems and this is how you solve them :)
Great exercise>
211:<Well, it is not specifically about mistakes but students in my class always know that ASKING QUESTIONS MAKES YOU SMARTER.  It's not about knowing everything or even getting everything correct on a test.  Questioning and wondering are important verbs in my class.  We also make a Mistake Tree, which I will post a photo of as soon as my teenager helps me figure out how!  :)>
212:<I like the idea of supporting learners in making attempts to fix 'mistakes'. I think that greater credit amounts could be given for going back and finding mistakes, as this is where the shifts in our self esteem can take place. *It's more important for us as humans to see where we can go a different route (and realizing that we aren't stuck in any given situation and that there are many routes to take to an answer.. and sometimes many answers), than it is to evaluate whether we are right or wrong all the time.* Great idea here.. I don't mind being incorrect in my work around my learners. They know I'm human, and they care about me regardless, and that is what they feel right back about themselves. :)>
213:<We are given negative maths images from media, I think, because we have all been taught, for the most part, in the same way for the last 100(?) years. Media (and in all areas of human communication you will find in regards to maths, for example: via tv, parents conversing with children, magazines, etc.) are saying these things because they instinctively need and want a change. We continually share the results of the previously unsuccessful era of maths learning, because that is all we know. It's time we get to know something different, and our words and attitudes can change and bring about positive reflection on maths. It's a difficult subject of discussion. Our feelings around how we have been all treated via the schooling system thus far (specifically around maths) are strong and are evidently coming out EVERYWHERE. One of the only places I personally don't find a lot of hatred towards loving maths ideas and questing to find answers, is via the on-line gaming community. :)>
214:<Those who do nothing make no mistakes.  Great line!!  I'm stealing this....
:)>
215:<I have struggled for a long time trying to group students within a class period (I teach High School) for collaborative activities.  Sometimes heterogeneous groups lead to stronger students "taking over" and doing most of the work, sometimes leaving struggling students "in the dust".  At other times heterogeneous groups have worked well where students have worked together and all members help each other understand the process before moving forward.  Homogeneous groups sometimes backfire if the weaker students just give up and can't see a wait to start while stronger students are done with the activity very quickly.

Now, after hearing about the research, I'm thinking that heterogeneous groups are the way to go.  I just need to learn better strategies for helping my students collaborate.  

20+ years in education and still learning!  :-)>
216:<I agree with you both! Loving all this good math teaching food, but in need mental space to process all this and a time buffer in light of beginning of school year tortures -er- meetings beginning soon, too. :-)>
217:<Great ideas! I like the math-construction zone metaphor, and I'm already learning about Dan Meyer's work. Thanks for sharing :)>
218:<Unless there is a foundation of Game Theory, Graph Theory and Number Theory in schools, then our schools will continue to flounder in creating disconnected topics riddled with boring syntax and horrible "applications".  There also has to be a viable and student-friendly bridge between arithmetic and algebra, where the generalization starts to occur with simplicity and curiosity--ie) The sum of three odd numbers always equals an ______ number.  And, without having a rich history of the subject in some kind of thematic coherence, any mathematics taught will be without color.
Too much emphasis on correctness.  We need to spend more time discussing problems that we as teachers cannot solve/didn't solve with our students.  The disarming of the anxiety in the classroom begins with honesty about our own mortal ability with the subject:)>
219:<My only request would be that we might be able to see an earlier math example (for 2nd grade or something) before being asked to come up with one.  The examples we've seen so far are great but definitely for middle/high school.  I am struggling to think of one outside of the realm of a normal story problem... but OK, I am off to be OK with the struggling. :-)>
220:<I like this idea :)>
221:<I would agree with this. I'm not sure my middle school students would understand the term "decomposing". I'm pretty sure they don't think as math as "free", either :)>
222:<Was anyone else worrying like I was that I may have made a mistake when I worked these 3 problems out?  I apparently am not free from my fixed mindset approach...but at least I am recognizing the awful thing for what it is. :)>
223:<I agree. The main asset of the dot card activity is that there is no wrong way or "better" way to do it. It's okay to be different. It's also cool that every student can quickly see another person's point of view. How often does that happen in real life? :)>
224:<If only people could follow directions :)>
225:<I just got mine to work!  I submitted 6.6!  I had to attach a random jpg file for it to be accepted...  :)  To get you submission to be taken, just find a random jpg file and attach it, and it'll probably get submitted.  I think they were intending us to attach jpg's of our maps she suggested we make while watching the interviews.>
226:<. 
    I remember reading about this in _What's Math Got To Do With It_, and I, too, wanted to figure out some way to convey this to the rest of the world so they'd understand it, because these "uncompressed math" learners and so many of their teachers assume that they just can't get fluent...
      I think, perhaps, that Sebastian hasn't been in the minds of an awful lot of folks, though.   He assumes that they're "mathing" things when... no, not necessarily.   Lots of functional citizens *don't* engage in even the basic mathy stuff.  To them, it *isn't* all addition with flair, compressed and elaborated.   Lots of 'em have forgotten the addition in their avoidance of that nasty stuff called math. 
      I was having some students review a video lesson from Algebra2go ( http://www.saddleback.edu/faculty/lperez/algebra2go/ ) about perimeter, and adding numbers, and one student thought the *best* part of the video was when he reminded the students (from a previous lesson these folks hadn't seen) that they could do "Kung Fu Math" and put the easy-combo numbers together first and then do the rest.  In our pre-pre-algebra course, we're going to do a *lot* of building those "tricks" -- and why they work ... ifI can find time to build those lessons in the next three weeks ;) 
     Another one of my ladies, this morning, was wrapping her mind around the connection between multiplying by a half, taking half of something, and dividing by two.   Watching her shift from the calculator to figuring out mentally that if the diameter is 206, the radius is 103, warmed the cockles of my heart :)
    We put together a sort of "crash course in concepts" last spring, borrowing from Dorothea Steinke's "part and whole" work ( http://www.ncsall.net/index.php@id=70.html has the link to a neat article about it) and Marilyn Burn's math concept inventory ( https://mathreasoninginventory.com   ) .   Oh, my, the number of people who "used the standard algorithm" for, say, 1000 - 997... mentally! That analogy of the ladder is painfully valid.  Even with just seven sessions, they were more successful when they dove into pre-algebra (hence our hope that a full semester of conceptual preparation for pre-algebra will have an even better effect).>
227:<Love your first line! I hope that you won't mind if I use it:)>
228:<I want to really drive home the idea that if something is EASY then you already know it and the actual learning occurs when things are challenging. When they complain that something (in any subject) is difficult I can get excited and yell, "Awesome! We are going to learn something here!" They will think I am a crazy person but I always loved my crazy teachers.... :)>
229:<Would you be willing to give a bit more information about your idea?  What generalizations are you thinking? Do you have other cases in mind when dealing with reciprocals? :) Thanks>
230:<In this video and the previous video, the label of pounds was applied for the turkey slices problem.  Did I just make your brain grow? :)  (I mean that in the lightest way possible.)

And if me commenting on this question at 12:45am doesn't tell you, I'm loving this course!  

Thanks for feeding me, Dr.Boaler!>
231:<Here's some links for you. Some of these are more accidental discoveries than "mistakes", but it required them to keep their eyes open and be willing to investigate an unusual idea. Not bad skills at all to be encouraging in a math class!

232:<It's not just OKAY to make mistakes, mistakes are GREAT! Mistakes are the BEST! (Or at least learning from them is the BEST)


Mistakes grow big, strong, healthy brains. :-)>
233:<I've looked and looked! (though I speak from a secondary/postsecondary perspective)...  here are a few things I've seen... "Making Math Real" from David Berg builds everything very methodically from concrete to abstract with many more steps and connections along the way, but it's all proprietary and you have to do his training to get the materials. "Hands On Equations" does some neat stuff, too... Dreambox.com sells their software that is very, very visual (but IMO needs more connections to verbal and math language).  Chinn and Ashcroft's _Math for Dyslexics_ describes lots of visual approaches... 
    Almost everything I find claims to be visual -- but what it really means is you have to look at it :P>
234:<Yea, it's funny that screaming through an ever-lengthening list of procedures again and again seems to be the "intervention" of choice. Finding the "challenging" that is not overwhelming can be a ... challenge, though :)>
235:<I did this method as well :)>
236:<I noticed that, too. Hopefully one of my students would notice if I mislabeled an answer (because they get a Pixie Stick in my class if they catch my errors). :)>
237:<I like this, tho' I have to laugh because ... it's a formula :)   I am picturing my students thinking "what do I have to do to get 'dig in' right?"   (because, as you noted, it takes a while to undo habits...)>
238:<A colleague, chicocarl, posted on this forum that mistakes are like snacks that make you hungry for learning.  I want my students to understand that mistakes help feed learning.  Therefore, I'm considering feeding students who make mistakes in hopes they will know mistakes are expected, welcome and good for growth in this classroom.  Wouldn't Pavlov be proud? :)>
239:<Oh my gosh, cfidel!  This is just what I was told when I was learning to ski, too!  I still remind myself of this when I'm trying to get down a particularly mogul-ly ice crusted part of a trail. ;-)  I tell my students this story every year, too! :-D>
240:<Here is a TED Talk by Dan Myers. He was the first person that gave me ideas on how to rewrite mathematics problems. I hope you enjoy! Adds to Session 4.2. :) 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWUFjb8w9Ps>
241:<I posted his link in a separate post! But here it is, just in case it's easier for some people to find. :) 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWUFjb8w9Ps>
242:<This sounds like what I feel as well as many of my colleagues. The materials provided are not conducive to a growth mindset and with the larger class sizes and combination classes we are finding it difficult to move forward. Report cards and state testing hang over our heads also. This is overwhelming when thinking of only math, then I think, "Oh My!" I have many other subjects that need the same revamping! Extremely overwhelming! Which is why we are sitting here on our summer time off writing to each other! :)>
243:<I find these last few segments of the material relate very closely to Sir Ken Robinson's talk on [How to Change Education - from the ground up][1]. He has for a while now been talking about changing education paradigms and I think these approaches to maths teaching are a perfect example of how that is happening.

245:<I like that last part about you need to work with your own brain.  :D>
246:<In my school we do not split students into ability groups for mathematics, but it is common practice for reading.  The research on grouping and its detrimental effects made a lot of sense, but I wonder how it would apply to language education.  However, since this course is about math, I'll stick to that!  Rather than group for mathematics, at my school we are encouraged to offer parallel questions.  When doing problem solving, we give 2 similar problems- one that might be more challenging, and one that might be slightly simpler- and give the students the option of which problem to choose.  Often the students will go for the more challenging problem.  :)>
247:<If I am not wrong is a quote from A. Einstein.  
**Agree !!!**

248:<My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>.  
I was 16 and enrolled in a high school third grade class in a north Italy city.  
I was a bit lazy and busy with other interests so I wasn't studying much, and therefore one of the lower grade student in English.  

One of my best fried was Nick, born in USA from Italian parents, almost as good in speaking, reading and writing English as a mother language one.  
One day our official teacher of English class had to go in hospital for two months and a substitute was coming to teach us English. 
She, the new teacher, could know us only by reading the notes of the official teacher, previous grades and votes.
 
Nick and I had the idea to exchange: I was him and he was me.... and of course the whole class was aligned ....  

Can someone imagine the results ?    

  :)

The consideration I wish to share with all of you is not so much the fact that the "new" <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> was doing rather well in English (In reality was Nick), but the fact that the "new" Nick was doing well in English, too. 

In other words I "improved" quite a lot my English performances "just" by changing my name or, in other words, changing the "ideas", "opinions", "past performances" which such name was representing in the head of a new teacher who based on written records.
 
Apart from the fun of it, it could be an example of how big a role preconceptions, prejudice and bias have in the teacher - student relationship.   

Hope you liked the experiments. Please comment if you wish so.

Bye

251:<Absolutely I recognize this behavior. In fact I know that I am often guilty of it myself :) although it is one of my goals to increase my wait time before answering a question and to allow students to experience more struggle on their own. 
Students are very uncomfortable with struggling; they want the answer so they can move on. As a teacher (and a parent) I am making a more conscious effort not to engage in the didactic contract readily.>
252:<The benefit of doing this with students is that they can see just how many different ways people have of counting/doing math. And that there's not one correct way. There's usually one correct answer, but how you get there is a creative process. I know I get stuck seeing things one way only, and it's so helpful to get ideas from other people... maybe someone uses a more efficient way, or a way that makes more sense than the way you've been thinking about it solely due to habit. Then you can 'steal' this new ideas/approaches and use them as your own! :)>
253:<Math is play!  Have fun!  If something doesn't work; try something else.  :)>
254:<Hey all -- is anyone else waiting on peer grading?  I have only received sufficient peer grades on the first assignment (1.3); I've worked all the way up to the halfway point of week 5. :-P  Thanks!>
255:<I too have seen students just confused by different methods - I know what you mean, especially at the lower level of math ability.  As soon as I get across the point that they don't need to master all the methods, but just use the one they like, they seem to relax, though.  :)>
256:<I thought about the "driving a car" experience as a case study for fixed versus growth mindsets... i thought about saying this:
"i remember when i first learnt driving, i was pitiful, i didn't know whether to focus on the acceleration pedal, or the hand brakes or the other brakes or the vitesse or the side mirrors or rear mirrors, the thought of "driving is probably not my thing" has crossed my mind... and my lips, but um lucky i had friends around me who refused this message from me, they wouldn't allow me to utter it again and rebuke me for thinking about, i had to drive for 3 hours 6 days a week in one of the the cities with the worst traffic jams, i started with a professional driver beside me to take charge in case any emergency might happen, then i let him go, then my friend who started driving 5 years before myself would ride beside me to keep company , to point if someone is trying to double me... et voila...i have been driving for 6 years now, and um still alive thank God:) so, my point is... there is no "too late in learning",  and there's no "um not made for this" in learning either! I want you to throw any negative messages you received or negative approaches you adopted regarding your skills or talents academically behind your back today! Because the key thing is time and practice... & practice and time..."
I would appreciate peer feedback on this as much as ever!>
257:<LOL :)   I *did* notice that we have to "learn to grade things" for each and every assessment.>
258:<Not only do students place into remedial courses (I work with exactly those folks at a community college), but even the ones who do a little better on the placement tests don't understand the concepts; they just know the procedures. 
  I read an amazing article about that conceptual stuff called  What Community College Developmental Mathematics Students Understand About Mathematics ( http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/carnegie-perspectives/what-were-learning/what-community-college-developmental-mathematics-students-understand-about-math ) It includes an analysis of test scores showing  common errors   demonstrating a rather profound lack of basic understanding of concepts. Extensive interviews showed that students relied on memorized procedures (even when they got answers correct), rather than comprehension, and that K-12 instruction emphasizes procedures. Fortunately, a Key quote:
“…these students who have failed to learn mathematics in a deep and lasting way up to this point might be able to do so if we can convince them, first, that mathematics makes sense, and then provide them with the tools and opportunities to think and reason.”  And that's why I'm here :)>
259:<Use ctrl click to open links in a new tab guys :P>
260:<I was first and foremost very interested in how the students interviewed were both enthusiastic about and confident in math.  It's like they felt they had learned some big secret about how to be successful later on!  I hope this success follows them -- they seem to regard fourth grade as a big scary thing, but they know how to handle it thanks to their heroic math teacher.

I'm a little surprised that they so freely say, "You can do what you want."  I think back to so many lunchtime conversations at my school among the math teachers absolutely *railing* at how students "invent" algebra.  "Don't they know there are rules for this sort of thing?!?"  It's not like these students will just do whatever they want, though; they appear to know that a decomposition or regrouping has to be right or useful, such as with the "friendly numbers."  I'd be interested to see if this is really the case.

Lastly, I'm surprised they call the teacher by his first name.  That would have resulted in some severe punishment when I was in elementary school.  :)>
261:<Indeed, mistakes help the individual in the act of learning to discover reality, to understand and realize the consequences of his mistake and to anticipate the risks involved.
Mistake should be part of learning. I have often led to solving a problem making a mistake results in order to verify the nurse's attention, the ability to make connections, knowledge and possibly comment on the result to defy logic. There were students asked me "but you know solving ?":)
There were those who did not accept mistakes while working. This has led to better understand my style of teaching and leave room for doubt before exclaim "I finished ...".
There are some professions where it is desirable not to make mistakes to learn from mistakes (doctor, aviator, scientist etc ...) even though that's exactly what happens. Analyze in detail why the causes of human error disasters.>
262:<I had definetely know idea people see math so differently.
Monday start the lessons here, and after a talk about mindsets I start with numbertalk in mathclass ;)>
263:<Can't agree more, great poster :)>
264:<That's the question we will discuss. Most likely i first split the group in two's or three's to let them get some answers at first. After a few minutes involve the whole group.

I always point out that they are Mathematicians, you do not need to have to get an university degree first: for if you are a football player (a big thing for the boys) when you go to football/soccer every Saturday, then they are surely Mathematicians since they do maths every week with me! So they, as a smallish group of boys and girls (8-11 years old), are in this/belong together.

In the discussion I make sure several characteristics are discussed:
- precision (you need to know what you are trying to accomplish)
- creativity (you are supposed to create your own maths)
- the argument given is important, not who gives it
- It is more fun and quicker when you cooperate;
- A solution is only a solution if you can explain & defend it well.
 (esp. with proofs, this is obvious and also goes against many stereotypes) 
- reflecting on a solution or a mistake is the best way to learn more
  (in fact failing on purpose, and then reflecting on the why is a good general heuristic)

Afterwards we will discuss (and laugh at) some suggestions of what is not needed, usually:
- smart parent(s)
- a computer
- money
- glasses
- a blue skin
- boobs
- a turtle head
anything ridiculously stereotypical :)>
265:<Here is a link to one spot on the internet that carries this poster...

There are quite a few that do carry it, but here is the first one that came up when I googled it.  There are also many different versions of this poster.  As I love to gross kids out occassionally, this one is my favorite!>
266:<I agree with your answers... was looking for the explanations though! :) I'm struggling to conceptualize the last problem (I know the algorithm, but would like to see different approaches)>
267:<Another great one, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrSUe_m19FY  because instead of focusing on failure, it focuses on what we do when we are "stuck" (and maybe why these people even feel stuck in the first place!?). In other words, what tools do we have to problem-solve... and I suppose a subtle second message is that we are too reliant on others / technology :)>
268:<Well, let's not put down those who **don't** make mistakes... :)  Instead, find a statement to encourage those students to find ways to challenge themselves.>
269:<Yes! I was surprised with the same thing,  Not typical vocabulary for an 8 or 9 year old :)  Great example of student motivation and high levels of vocabulary and practice when given the chance to work through appropriate problems.>
270:<It's good to see math in action and to see positive response from students.  Being able to view problems in different ways and learning from peers will help students to be more creative in their ways of solving problems. :)>
271:<I agree with this; recently I made a simple arithmetic mistake but it was sort of public in front of co-workers. I'm supposed to be an expert in math (according to them) and so I was embarrassed and worried about what they might think of me. It didn't make me think that I wasn't good at math, and I wasn't overjoyed at the opportunity to learn more. :) I was mostly worried about how others would judge me.>
272:<Hello!  My name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, and I'm a 3rd grade teacher living in Colorado.  I am here to deepen my understanding of teaching and learning math.  I absolutely love teaching math; I received my Ed.S. in Mathematics in 2010.  For the past 3 years, I have worked with partially-proficient kiddos and loved the experience.  This year, I have been asked to work with the proficient and proficient-plus learners. I am looking forward to learning from the vast experiences and knowledge of this community.  THANK YOU, Jo, for making this opportunity available to us! 

For any Coloradans out there, I am a teacher in the Cherry Creek School District, and my school is in Centennial.

:) So very glad to be here!>
273:<...the concrete things that numbers can represent.  Cards like this remind us that numerals represent quantities, and that combining quantities, an important basic skill, can be done in many ways.  The "shorthand" of using numerals and operations to combine quantities can represent an infinite list of things--  dots, apples, people, blades of grass, atoms, buckets of water, molecules of water, discussions, feelings...

With dot cards the focus is on the idea of quantities, and not on the numbers-- not on the written figures 3, 5, etc-- that the quantities represent.

I think this also reminds us that the concept of a number and the quantity it represents is incredibly broadly applicable, and in fact, I find it quite profound.  "Two-ness" ,"three-ness," "100-ness" can apply to blocks, handfuls of dirt, years of life, minutes, experiences... concrete things as well as abstract things...  So cool...:)>
274:<In case anyone is interested, here's the link to the [movie clip][1] from Little Big League.

275:<I continually have discussions with my students about the fact that the point of being at school (and in life) is LEARNING THINGS, not being assessed on stuff. We talk a lot about why I don't provide revision sheets, why our assessment is always progressive and only summative when I can really not do anything about it. This term I have managed to clear my senior class of all assessment :D (by having worked ahead with them). They asked me why there was no assessment this term and I told them "this term we are just going to learn, not train for tests - what do you want to explore?" Getting answers right is no-where near as important as going on a learning journey. I hope this is the message I keep conveying to my students.>
276:<I always produce pep talks throughout the year that I get my students to read. They end up making fun of me but hey, so long as their mindset improves, no problem :). 
Here is an example:

**Mr <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>'s 'Pep Talk' Number 1**

**Make and share mistakes so that we make our learning better and become smarter.**

'In Mr. <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>'s Maths classes, we learn as a team.  Learning is messy and making mistakes is messy but don't worry as educational research says that this all makes our learning better and makes us smarter by growing our brain when things are wrong or are challenging.  Here are some success criteria to help us to improve our learning together. Remember to:

 1. Always make deliberate and thoughtful attempts so that you are able to justify, reason or explain to me or others the learning in your head.
 2. Study your mistakes so that you learn to pinpoint the learning problem, and can begin to see how to improve them.
 3. Be happy and willing to share your mistakes so that other members of the team may learn from them too; be selfless.
 4. Be respectful and attentive to others mistakes so that our team is not afraid to share mistakes and be able to learn from them another time.
 5. Only give critical but constructive feedback that improves learning. Make it honest but respectful so that they will offer ideas another time.
 6. Read the three quotes below if you're ever worried about making mistakes:

Thomas Edison (1879) – inventor of the light bulb amongst other things:

> I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.

And Einstein said:

> Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

And lastly, Samuel Beckett, writer and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1969)

> Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.>
277:<Practice !   Figure out a few patterns and oh, when you're on the road and see a license plate, add the numbers ;)   It's geeky but nobody will know... when you see "10% off" figure out what that is by movingthe decimal... and then double it for 20%...>
278:<The first item on the Mathematical Practices list in the Common Core is "1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them."  Would it be constructive to add something like "and capitalize on mistakes made in the process of solving"?  I wonder what the fallout would be if making mistakes was listed as a Common Core Mathematical Practice! :)>
279:<Here's an idea: do your own research. Experiment with different types of feedback, and then ask the students what kind of feedback they liked best, ie what was most helpful.  Then publish it for the rest of us to learn from :)>
280:<I don't think I've ever heard a student describe math as being free.  Wow!  This is a revelation of how students can be freed up to do math.  PS I would have liked to seen some comments from the girls in the class:)>
281:<I always have different ideas for these types of questions and although I have already answered in the task section I've just seen another. By the way, they look like cans to me rather than cubes.  Maybe I'll use those in class! :-)

Start with the first case.  We could take a single can and put it on top of the other single can to create a square.  We now have a square of side 2 thus there are 2^2=4 cans.
We could also use the idea that (case <zipRedac> + <zipRedac>)^2 = 4

In the second case we can create a square of side 3 which will give us 3^3=9 cans.
We could also use the idea that (case 2 + <zipRedac>)^2 = 9

We can repeat this for any case.
We now know that the number of cans in any case, let's call it n, will always be the square of <zipRedac> more than the case; this is because we have rearranged the original shapes into squares.

So for case n, the number of cans = (n+<zipRedac>)^2

And for <zipRedac>00 cases, the number of cans = (<zipRedac>00+<zipRedac>)^2 = <zipRedac>020<zipRedac> cans.>
282:<On session 1, I would just be happy with a 1, :)>
283:<I have been thinking a lot about some of the ideas that you presented in the last video.  I feel that, besides the ability grouping and tracking, pull outs and even special education or resource where the student is pulled from class would also cause similar feelings in students. I was very frustrated with 2 students last year that just didn't seem to be progressing in class.  They did not qualify for special education and I couldn't seem to get any help for them.  Now I realize that there was more that I could have done to give them a better educational experience.  I would like a do over.  :)  Seriously though I think that this applies to reading as well as math.  I also think that I will have a hard time getting my team to change their way of thinking.  I am going to use mixed groups and work hard to be a growth minded teacher.  Wish me luck!>
284:<Thanks for sharing that, Rachel. It's true - the power that words have is huge :-)>
285:<Hi everyone. I was thinking it would be great if we could crowdsource creating a "Mathematical Thinking Process" poster based on Professor's Boaler's work as shown in [Session 6, Part 3][1].

287:<Grouping has never made any sense to me. I have chosen to never be a part of it. I left teaching for years because of it and am now working with home learning children where this issue rarely arises.  My own children are autodidacts and self motivated learners.( 2 of them never went to school) and - without even knowing it- I supported a growth mind set in them. As adults they are now fully functioning and engaged members of society - passionately doing their own thing.

The other thing that has never made sense to me is grouping based on age. (ie 6 years old means grade 1.) So often this equates to socialization with only your particular age group..... and this happens NOWHERE ELSE in society. As an adult, I have many friends - older and younger - with a variety of educational backgrounds. What we share in common are interests and passions. I think children should be allowed the same freedom of association.

I guess I am "outside the box" on this one.... :)>
288:<Thank you so much for responding. :)>
289:<When students were in this class, I can see them as thinking it was a sort of game.  Who can come up with another way to solve this problem?  They are motivated to be creative and unique while manipulating number.  A dream class:)>
290:<Funny they use the word "free" :-)>
291:<:)  Yes my brain is also growing.  I think the students are going to love making mistakes!>
292:<First of all the dot card in the video looks like "diamond plating" on the back running board of a fire engine.

Okay.  Dot cards give you a visual representation to work from and toward a visualization of the numbers you see.  Dot cards provide an exercise in seeing patterns. Reinforce open mindset.  You can see in many different ways.

Dot cards give my brain a chance to drive a bit backwards, sideways, and serpentine in counting and representing numbers.  Instead of going from a value in standard form to a picture, I am able to see a value in picture form moving toward a standard form representation.  Dot cards give the brain flexibility, plasticity and allow for creativity.

It is also fun to see and hear other "sightings."   Personal UFOs.  :)>
293:<Thank you!  You saved me some searching:)>
294:<I submitted my answer to 5.3 and then realized I made a mistake.  Although that is supposed to be a great thing, so is the opportunity to fix it:) I tried to click on reset but it would not let me make any changes... Now what?>
295:<My lesson 1 questions have finally been scored.  :-)>
296:<I make mistakes many times in math class, intentional and  unintentional.  I love it when my students catch the mistake, it shows them that we all do it.  I tell them that is why pencils have erasers :)>
297:<Anders: From what I have seen of flipped classrooms, there is little to NO interaction between students. At least, no interaction that is math related. (They might talk about the game last Friday night.) And, that is my biggest concern about the recent clamor for a flipped classroom. And, for MOOCs and online learning for that matter. Are we really willing to say that the discussions and interaction are not important enough to make time for them? That really worries me. 

Take a look at this video. It is well worth the time, and really nails one of the fundamental problems of the flipped classroom. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CHoXRvGTtAQ
Also, Khan himself recently did a video on making class time not the time to work on routine homework. It is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OtSs2xEpzY

I think we need to be cautious in our rush to embrace a flipped classroom.>
298:<I feel the same way. After I do the lesson and before I call a group, I walk around and watch the student's do their independent work. I try to pull students who I noticed were struggling on the current lesson first.  This is not the same set of students every time. Then I try to call over as many students as I can before the " exit ticket time.  I was not sure if this was the right way to do it. But if there are more than 5 students who are struggling I may assign a mentor. Now I am questioning the way I do it. I feel like I am grouping them without the title of the group.???  :( The students who do their independent work are able to grade their own work with the answer key, with a different color pen and then are asked to hand it in before they can work on center work.  The centers are student choices.  I have a tick tac toe board every week with different tasks they can accomplish. It ranges from "review" work to Challenge activities.  If the student wants to get a tic tac toe for the week they HAVE TO COMPLETE a challenge activity. This can be done with a buddy of their choice or independently.  At the end of the week all students have to make one tic tac toe for "credit" and then if they wanted to try to get more than one tic tac toe it is worth more.  :)  It become as a fun game for my students and they have the ability to work at a level of their choice and be challenged.>
299:<(I posted this in the wrong place & then couldn't find it to move it! Sorry if it's in here twice)
OMG! Here's the evolution of my thought on this problem:

 1. (Stalling a bit while telling myself this is not for a grade)
 2. Yikes! She's making me do math? I haven't a clue! 
 3. Oh. There's that Fixed Mindset thing, huh.
 4. Started counting the number of cubes in each case. Not seeing a pattern, other than the one in the picture I cannot yet articulate.
 5. Started writing the total cubes for each case and extending the pattern to case 4 and case 5. Still not seeing anything. Slight panic setting in--- instinct to "look up the answer". Beat down this feeling by remembering that it's supposed to be challenging. I'm growing my math brain.
 6. Since the pattern in the totals was not obvious to me, decided to see how the totals were increasing. From 4 to 9 is 5; from 9 to 16 is 7; from 16 to 25 is 9; from 25 to 36 is 11. 
 7. Oh, look. A pattern. 5, 7, 9, 11....  
 8. So I don't have to painstakingly draw or write out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1  etc. on each one. I can use the pattern to find the totals. (there must be a shorter way.... I'll work on that later)
 9. I made a chart, with boxes for cases 1-10 in the top row. I wrote the totals I had so far, and in-between the boxes, a little triangle with the odd numbers increasing in the pattern I already noticed. I then filled in the rest of the totals by using those odd numbers. I continued this process, with a row for cases 11- 20 and  a row for 21 - 30, and looked again for patterns. I noticed that in the "9s" column the totals were even hundreds. Then I noticed that all the cases in the first column ended in 4, second column all ended in 9, 3rd column all ended in 6 etc. Don't know how that helps me yet, but it's interesting.  Then I noticed, looking at the 9th column, the hundreds went from 100, 400, 900... I wonder if the next one will be 1600, since the first totals were 4, 9, 16. I'll do another row and see.
 10.  Yes! And now I know how to figure the rest. Going down just row 9, continuing the pattern of totals and the pattern of odd numbers, box 99 will be 10,000--- so the total for case 100 will be 10,201.
 11. Answering backward-- for the first question,  "How do [I] see this shape growing." The stacks per case are growing by odd numbers-- 3, 5, 7, 9 etc.
 12. I've never smiled while doing a difficult (for me) math problem before. :-D Now I'm curious to know how to do this a shorter wa>
300:<[Here is my poster!  :)][1]

301:<I like this - I may use it myself :-)>
302:<I thought that you may find this interesting and maybe you can use it for teaching multiplication: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwaAAEYIW_8 The question could be why it works? Enjoy! ;)>
303:<This was a good problem for me.  I was as clueless as some of my 4th grade students when I present some problems.  As Jo Boaler whipped through the explanation in a couple of nano seconds, I was left in the dust and feeling quite bruised -- not sure if I still wanted to continue the play.  So I emailed my son.  The exchanges are copied to below:

Hi -- Sam takes 3 hours to paint a house, Joe takes 5 hours,  How long does it take for both of them together?  It's not intuitive to me that it will take less than 3 hours, but that appears to be the case.  (I would think that Joe would slow Sam down.)
Anyway 1/3 + 1/5 = 8/15.  for how much is painted in one hour. 
 [This is where I get lost:  multiply by 15/8 and get the answer.]  
  The answer is 1 7/8 hours.  
huh?
something about a + b / axb

Answer: If it takes Sam 3 hours to do the house, he does 1/3 of the house in an hour = 5/15. Likewise, Joe does 1/5 = 3/15. So together they do 5/15 + 3/15 =8/15 of the house per hour. That's the rate. . 
The basic equation you're solving for is: R*T=D, where in this case D=amount of house to paint, R=rate of painting, and T=time. So for this example, it is:
(8/15) * T = 1
So T = 15/8

Reply:  Ok. I can plug it into the formula but how does the formula make sense?  I get the rate is 8/15 of a house in one hour. D or distance is the amount of house needed to be painted.  In this case, 1 house. How would you explain 15/8 without the formula?

Answer: Not sure what you're asking.

D = R times T
if D = 1, R = 8/15, solve for T:
T = D / R = 1 / (8/15) = 15/8

Reply:  Yes. I got the algebra part.  But w/out the algebra equation, how can you explain/justify using 15/8?  For instance I could draw a picture of a house cut into 3 sections and one cut into 5 sections. I could draw another house as my goal (D) w both people painting and show it 8/15 finished after one hour.  By solving it further and taking 7/15 of an hour, 60 minutes, (what is left to complete on the house)  I get 28 minutes.  But how would I illustrate using 15/8? 

Answer:  That's where you're messing up; it's not 7/15 of an hour left, it's 7/15 of the job. 
I think it would be hard to visualize this, since it's a Time problem without whole numbers. I guess you could show a house divided up into 15ths, and show how many were done after the first hour. But ultimately, since the answer is 15/8, you'd have to get down to how much gets done every 7.5 minutes (1/8th of an hour), which isn't pretty.

304:<I also wonder, though, if it might mean that he is looking for shortcuts!  Nothing in math is as good as a good shortcut! :)>
305:<I teach middle schoolers so  #1- They are social beings! (as are all of our students, but middle schoolers even more so). They need/want to talk. Better to talk about my math challenges than their weekend plans. :)

#2- Talking helps everyone solidify their own thinking. I tell them if they can explain it first orally, it will help them clarify their thinking for the paper/pencil explanation (if required). 

#3- Hearing other ways to solve problems helps other students open up to new ideas, new methods, new relationships. I tell students the best moment for me is when I hear a student say, "Ohhhh!!! Now I get it!" and that only happens on days when we're discussing something. They never make that realization on test day! :)>
306:<I Have always pushed the idea of mistake are a learning opportunity with my students, but i have never actually discussed any of the research behind it. I think that if I were going to be in the classroom again I would not only stress that i love mistakes becasue we learn the most from them, but I would also use the research to back this up. I might even have the students look up some of the research to support this claim and present out what they find :)>
307:<I also liked that they had been taught about learning from mistakes, and that everyone makes them. I also liked their use of the word, "decompose":)>
308:<http://map.mathshell.org/materials/lessons.php?taskid=482&subpage=problem>
309:<Dot cards provide a good entry point in Number Talks.  It's a nice way to introduce the idea and process of a number talk in a non-intimidating format.  No multiplication required. :)  You and students will quickly see that people see things different ways and gives you the opportunity to set the stage for exploring and benefiting from those differences within the classroom throughout the year.>
310:<Hi, I have read the other posts regarding feedback but am still a little confused. I am grading more than the allocated number. In my progress bar I can see some of the scores are 0/1 and some 1/1. How do I know whether the 0/1 means that my response was rubbish, or whether it is yet to be marked? And also the ones that are marked 1/1, how do I see the peer feedback? Help!
Thank you :)>
311:<I remember discussing that equals sign as a balance. It's hard to convey, though, especially to students who not only conceptually think equals means "points at the answer" (and http://olms.cte.jhu.edu/olms/data/resource/9231/Why%20Cant%20Students%20Get%20Concept%20Math_Week%2010.pdf  describes this (I can't seem to make this a working link..  -- the whole International Dyslexia Assoc. "math" issue is online at http://www.resourceroom.net/Math/perspectives_dyslexia_math.pdf ) 
... and *especially* to my students who've developed some incredible visual imitation strategies that almost always work... until algebra. 

    One lady at a conference described success with having students draw a little "balance of justice" over the equals sign.   I had a student that I noticed drawing a dashed vertical line from the equals sign to help separate those two sides that were supposed to balance.   I've stolen and shared madly :) 

   Another strategy that we used in our short, intense "conceptual foudnations" class and will be trying out with the pre-pre-algebra folks is that we can call the same thing two different things... and still be talking about the same thing.  Another thing we're trying to do is to have a "fault-resistant" class, so I've been scrapping together narrated powerpoints for folks who miss a class or want a review, and http://www.resourceroom.net/math/roughvids/1equalsmeansnomic.pptx  is my rough for "what equals means."   It's very validating to see similar things expressed here!

312:<Grandfathers usually know best! :)>
313:<I loved this! These boys feel like math is fun. At no time did they mention speed or fluency. Instead, they sounded as if they were discussing art. These young men are building a fabulous foundation in math. Algebra will be a natural and challenging extension instead of a chore. I wasn't so much surprised as delighted by their thoughts. :)>
314:<:)>
315:<Hi Jo!
Just went through the formative assessment question in 4.7.
It is very well done and has my mind thinking of how I can apply this to my classroom this year!  I am teaching 2/3 and wondered if you knew of any other good sites with questions such as these for the younger grades!
Thanks and I am enjoying the course!
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> :)>
316:<:)
me too>
317:<I was surprised how the students used the words "free" and "decompose".  How math was not about rules - solve it anyway you want (I think this was very cool - makes me excited about getting back in the fall to teach my math class :)  As for the word decompose - just thought it was a big word for the 3rd graders - but really shows that they have good number sense if able to actually "decompose".>
318:<Excellent question, let me answer with a question-if it is actually meaningful to students this year will it hold the same meaning for all following students? ;)>
319:<Definitely agree with your update! Hope somebody answers :)>
320:<So my question would be this:   is that algebraic thinking? 
It's definitely mathematical thinking. It definitely could be expressed in algebra (just a different equation).  


I'm thinking that "algebraic thinking" involves generalizing, and that stuff of "true for whatever number," so that the "whatever the number of dimes is, the value will be 0.10 times that."

(I'm posing the question as a question... not something I think I know the answer to ;) )>
321:<:)>
322:<I'm still waiting to have 3 questions peer assessed.  How long should it take?  Could there be another reason they aren't graded?  It is affecting my completion of the sessions.  

TIA
1luv2learn (a.k.a. <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> :)>
323:<Yup - I managed to do them all using exactly four fours and one or two "non-obvious" operations :)>
324:<yay! for Delaware :)  I'm hoping to learn some great new ideas as well!>
325:<She has an equation and she is getting it to equal 1 house painted.
So she multiplied by the reciprocal of 8/15 on both sides of the equation.

Hard to explain this in writing...but see if that helps at all :-)
It is a challenging problem to explain and to understand.>
326:<Ha.  That's what people said when I give this problem to my students AND their parents:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=<phoneRedac><zipRedac>2334&set=pb.<phoneRedac><zipRedac>6151.-<phoneRedac>.1<phoneRedac><zipRedac>9.&type=3&theater>
327:<Many of my students and parents came up with 2 by estimation when I gave them this similar problem:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=<phoneRedac><zipRedac>2334&set=pb.<phoneRedac><zipRedac>6151.-<phoneRedac>.1<phoneRedac><zipRedac>9.&type=3&theater>
328:<I know!!!!  I keep checking back .... sent another email ... and was excited to see NO peer reviews for session 7.   Still never reviewed and for session 5 and 6 since "being locked out" of peer reviewing ... and I was even wanting to help with the session 1 backlog :)>
329:<Hi Lambda - I'm sorry, but that is not quite the same question.  Because in the polyhedron, a pair of points that are co-linear - right next to each other - would not make a diagonal.  But in your soccer team, they would constitute a pair. 

If you put the 11 points on a circle, and then asked: "how many lines can you draw connecting a pair of points" it would be the same question.  :)>
330:<Tonight I told my husband and kids (13 and 15 yrs old) about the 3 problems I was doing for this class, and everyone got into solving them.  I have to say, there was a lot of laughing and shouting and struggling with mainly the last problem.  Finally, my husband gave in and solved it using the formula, but my son was closest to figuring it out with a picture, and I was able to approximate it.  But, it made for a great discussion and a lot of laughing and bantering back and forth at the dinner table.  :)>
331:<I guess we all   agree that "making sense"  in the main thing i this video. I would want to know though what stage of teaching division of fractions is this? It looks like  students already  were given rule, right? at least some of them were talking about it. So is it introductory lesson ar what? Because if it is not introductory then previous one was not quite successful. A agree with comments that with all pressure put o us with standardized tests having this discussions is not quite doable.  We do not have freedom any more to TEACH. We have tons of people that come to our classrooms and  force us to teach the way they think. Then others come and say opposite. Making sense -   I don't believe that there is any Math teacher that wouldn't agree on that. So let us teach :-)
I wish I could see the curriculum of that Arizona school  that taught  exclusively using inquary and was successful. I plan on finding it out. How it was done>
332:<I have often had the same moments, when it has been possible to talk about mistakes. I am also going to begin my year with talking about how important a mistake is, and getting things wrong is a good way to make progress. I will be thinking of a slogan to have on all my power points, to remind the students I am happy with mistakes - as long as they learn from them :-)>
333:<Yea, that was my thought -- that I needed to expand my definition of "operations," so I left it to somebody else ;)>
334:<I tried to apply a little generalization to the task... to find a cheap way of turning four into other numbers...  got as far as root 4 being a cheap "two" when I got interrupted :) Didn't think of factorial.  If I have time (but I won't, now that I think of it ;)) I'll try to figure the rest out *before* I look closely at your answers (now I'm glad the text all runs togehter -- I just skimmed it and saw the 4!>
335:<I'm an adult learner who wants to return to Math after being inspired by this course. What resources (books, online courses/tutorials) are there, that a self-learner can use, that abide by the concepts taught in this course? I'm willing to start from elementary math to build a good foundation, so I welcome any and all resources! =)>
336:<I don't think it's the end of the world. I think it can be a *symptom* of a bigger problem -- thinking the a stands for actual apples, and not their quantity -- but if you're addressing that, you're okay.   Since it's one of the "big ideas" that keeps coming up, I am constantly stressing that a variable stands for a number, not a thing... 
... if you call 'em x and y, the student can still think they stand for the fruits.  It's in how you package those fruits and variables :)>
337:<I think that I will start with a non-math activity we all do together (suggestions welcome :)) where we make mistakes together, myself included and embrace the mistakes. Then we can talk about our willingness or not to have the same attitude towards maths and then perhaps ask kids to make video or posters or poem to encourage/support mistakes.>
338:<Thanks for sharing such a great connection to how we learn from our mistakes:)>
339:<I will first share the brain research with my students and explain how learning new things and working on "hard" problems helps our brains grow.  I will compare it to sports, art, etc.  You get stronger, better with practice.  

Then I will connect easy problems and lack of brain growth to being cheated.  I will tell my students that my job is to NOT CHEAT THEM.  My job is to inspire them, help them grow, give them opportunities to learn, and help their "brains get bigger".  =)  I teach third grade so I think this is sure way to get them pumped to learn and to "catch me" when I'm not doing my job.>
340:<That's a fun motto! I like that a lot!! :)>
341:<Great! I could visualise the race :)>
342:<Love this section - Number talks use not only the logical side of the brain but also the creative and communicative part. Maybe this method makes the brain grow because it uses both sides of the brain allowing them to connect:)>
343:<Grade 3  Math is:Perhaps they would say math is easier this way, more fun and interesting; breaking numbers apart; making harder problems easier by the way numbers are arranged; getting to do math their own way; having to think about how the numbers work; seeing different ways of doing the same problem;listening and following what others are saying. Hmmm,the boys are doing the responding. Are the girls already deferring to the males at this level?>
344:<Good example. :-)>
345:<At first I didn't see the point of this exercise for older students, but as I reflect on the purpose I can see that it is a very powerful way to show students that there are many ways to view and solve a problem.  There is not just one "right" way.  I can see that the discussion would challenge students to come up with unique ways to be different.  Math is creative :)>
346:<I agree with how nonchalant they were about making mistakes. They did not take them personally, they knew all people made mistakes and knew they would get help. They were so positive. :)>
347:<This is a wonderful story.  It really illustrates the idea that mistakes are our friends and we shouldn't be afraid of them.   Thanks for sharing. :)>
348:<I came here looking for that comment.  I was wondering if anyone else heard that, too. :-)>
349:<I totally agree, this was also the way i answered the question (and find also more useable :)>
350:<I like your idea....especially since it is related to history which I teach in addition to math.  Anytime I can relate the two subject areas is a bonus!  This will be a great intro lesson in both classes. :)>
351:<Math is free and there is more than one way to get a right answer. That's something most kids (at least by the time they get to me in high school) wouldn't say. By then, it's all about memorizing the right rules instead of truly understanding the numbers.

I also loved how that one kid talked about decomposing numbers being cool. :)>
352:<I found references (some with internet links) at the top of this page/site labeled "References"  All I had to do was click on it :) 

I too am interesting in reading more and improving my practice. 

Hope this helps>
353:<Many of my adult learners wouldn't dream of doing this. They will soon :)>
354:<I agree -- that this is a really important part of teaching. My explanations are always perfect ... until the students interpret them... and then I realize the loopholes I left in ;)>
355:<A= apples 

P=pears

A=P-.02

P= A+.02

No values given for numbers of A or P

Pears are more expensive than apples.>
356:<I looked at some of the posts that were made earlier and I borrowed one about showing a video ... and added a few other options ...

----------
Students watch so much Youtube, and I think that they would respond to these short videos about making mistakes.  I would follow up the video(s) with a think alone, pair share, group share, and class share about their thoughts regarding making mistakes.  Then I would encourage them that mistakes are expected in the class and explain how evidence has found that mistakes make your brain grow and you become smarter because of the mistakes you make.  :)>
357:<I loved how the boys used the word "free". I don't think I have ever heard a child describe math as free and think that they can do whatever they want to solve the problem. I appreciate that they have that confidence. They also weren't afraid of mistakes and felt safe making them, that was apparent in their answers. The fact that they all liked math was wonderful as well!!! That's half the battle, getting students to enjoy then subject enough to really dig in and learn! They alos really loved the word "decompose" :)>
358:<Same issue here! I just do a few extra each time and move on! hopefully it will be resolved by the time we are all done. Cheers :)>
359:<I am hoping that we learn in the next session that this is the type of question to avoid...at least for a while:)>
360:<- You can do what you want.
- It's really cool.
- I like decomposing. :)>
361:<So this is a pretty rough/first draft, but I think it has potential. :)

First, have students create statements that they have heard, been told, said to themselves or to a friend or would like to hear when they work (when they make a mistake).  Some examples may include  “I believe you can change your intelligence, or “I like working hard to learn something new”, “I would rather do something easy and not make mistakes than work hard to learn something new”, or “You cannot change how smart you are.” 

Have students write down a few statements that are applicable to what they believe.

Then, pairs/triples of students separate (categorize) the statements and give each group a title/name.

Share out with the class/large group about how and why they decided to separate the statements and why they chose their title.

Then, share a powerpoint (like http://www.laurelschool.org/about/documents/BrainTraining.pdf) or a reading (like http://www.mindsetworks.com/websitemedia/youcangrowyourintelligence.pdf) about Fixed and Growth mindset.  

Have students revisit their statement groups and determine whether they aligned to fixed/growth mindsets or something else. Have small groups pair up with other small groups for the discussion.

Finally, have students determine whether they are currently at a Fixed or Growth Mindset and write a few phrases that encourage the Growth mindset whether or not they are currently there.>
362:<I was unable to type text into the lesson. My new poster would read:
Mistakes are knowledge in disguise. Let's all go undetected! Poster would include a photo of me with a disguise on :-) You could even have each student make their own poster with a disguise or themselves, or a large poster with each student in disguise. Fun.>
363:<I'm trying something different, perhaps a bit cheeky. Not sure if it works - read the learning goals first before the big reveal:

We are looking at numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on. These are called 'natural numbers', but we'll just say 'numbers' for now. If you know about negative numbers, then just try to forget them for now :-)

Goals:

1. I understand that any number always has just one other number that is one bigger than it. The bigger number is called the 'successor' of the other number.

2. I understand that there is a number called 'zero' that is not one bigger than any number. So, it's not the successor of any other number.

3. I understand that if I can't see two numbers, but I know they have the same successor, then those two number must be the same number.

4. I understand that, if we make a collection of numbers that has zero in it, and we make sure every number in the collection also has its successor in the collection, then that collection contains all numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on).

You could call this 'axiomatic number theory for kids' :-) This is a rewriting of the Peano Axioms of axiomatic number theory in a phenomenological way. Seems obvious? Perhaps it's *too* obvious and easily overlooked. If the above makes sense, then you are well on your way to understanding the basis of all modern number theory .. and perhaps you'll pause to wonder why numbers exist in our universe at all.>
364:<I submitted the same example :)>

366:<It's sad that what was surprising to me was the boys' response to the question, "do you like math?"- a resounding, "yes!" I agree, Holly, it is so refreshing to hear these young boys describing math so enthusiastically and even with a nice thumbs up! :) As parents and educators, we can only hope that these kind of feelings about math will not be so surprising in the future, but the norm. You can tell that they feel empowered by the range of strategies and tools they have learnt together and that their own ideas have been validated. I agree with what has been said about the boy's use of the word "free" to describe math. I am reminded of the poem 'Math Makes Me Feel Safe' by Betsy Franco. What a beautiful irony that math can not only make us feel safe, in that there is usually an answer which we can find, which will never change, and is not subjective, but that we are free to find that answer in many, many ways! Would love to read a poem written by the boy entitled 'Math Makes Me Feel Free'!>
367:<... another topic that I think is worth exploring is how to steer use of technology in appropriate directions.   I say this because while I was waiting for "eight" to be posted, a discussion of how technology coudl transform adult ed was started at https://community.lincs.ed.gov/discussion/welcome-first-day-discussion-%E2%80%9Chow-can-technology-transform-adult-education-and-current-pr  ... and... the first paragraphs described how important it was to get our students thinking critically and solving problems and embracing challenge... and then I got to where it said "Most instructional strategies are too difficult to implement by human teachers. "  
   Then it listed wonderful principles -- things like bridging concrete to abstract and asking and answering deep questions, so... I thought... at least they want the same things. 
    Then, he listed the programs that could do it -- and 2 of the three I know well to be completely procedure-based drill-and-practice programs. I got a very creepy Orwellian feeling... and posted a reply asking just how the program in question addressed questions 2,3, etc... 
    If we're not even going to be allowed to teach, because after all, we can't possibly implement good instructional strategies... 
    
     I've had a lot of my thoughts validated in this course (my father was a physicist... impossible not to appreciate math...) and gotten a lot of new ideas! Some of them have to be worked with to make work with my very scarred, very scared population, and this is the first chance I've had to actually collaborate in curriculum development... so here goes :) :)>
368:<I never found it either.   And, of course, we were asked in a survey about stuff we hadn't seen yet ;)   Maybe this should be under 'questions for jo' ...>
369:<I was surprised by the academic language and vocab these 3rd graders used.  Decompose:)
I wish though that shewould have asked that student why he didn't think these exercises were helpful...>

375:<I should have thought that 4 hours does not make sense at all, at all, as it takes the one guy 3 hours. I thought I was being clever, when in the end I was foolish not to make sure my answer was reasonable. Thank you very much for taking the time to explain this, Chuck 5 string. :) I like the 15 hours for both and working out that way. Thanks!>
376:<I haven't figured out yet exactly what I am going to say (maybe I will have a better idea after I read some posts :)  ) but I definitely plan on talking about how the brain works and how a new synapse is created when a mistake is made. That will lead into a conversation about how my classroom will be a place where mistakes will proudly be made.>
377:<Let's make it more transparent as Sebastian has done! Clearly we, too, use math daily...as do our students...they may not realize it is math:)>

379:<Oh... thanks for the suggestion :)>
380:<Here in Mexico we have a national problem with maths. I teach at the university, in careers like Actuary and Applied Mathematics. Even the students in the last grades of these careers have difficults learning math. 
I have very large groups, with 70 students each. It is almost impossible for me -I think, but I'd love to be corrected :-) - to apply some of the ideas you have shared with us. Besides, as university teacher, I have to research, participate in comitees of different kinds, give counseling, mantain a virtual learning environment... But I promess I will try.
I remember that one of my kids told me about a fifth grade student whom they called "the forty two". Do you imagine why? Because they were sorted by their math grades and he was always de 42 in a list of... 42 students. Can you imagine his feelings?
I've had great experiences with my university students, but now I think I will use some new strategy. I'll try to give more space to student's work and less to my "speech".>
381:<I think many of us teachers have fallen into that trap, because of the state testing being the measure that we are all held accountable we try to keep the majority of students mastering skills to meet state standards. That is where the best practices are coming from and the common core that those have to stop and we have to teach the whole child and help each child grow in their knowledge since all children can learn :)>
382:<That is great, I am thinking about the same thing this year, I have taken a workshop on Family math and there are new resources coming out in the teacher supply store linked to common core that might have some ideas. I will try to share any that I might find :) I agree it would be a great way to show and challenge kids as well as take the fear of problem solving out of math if it was a fun activity :)>
383:<Leave your fear of making a mistake at the door.
Once you enter this room, realize that all of us will make mistakes, and we will freely use them to learn from each other.  We will celebrate learning here which means mistakes will be welcome :).>
384:<Three slices weighing 1/3 of a pound and he can eat 1/4 of a pound so each slice then weighs 1/3 of 1/3 so each slice then weighs 1/9 of a pound. If he is able to eat 1/4 of a pound he can definitely eat 2/9 because 2/9 is less than 1/4. If 9 slices is a pound then he can eat 1/4 of this.....I already know that's two whole slices then 1 slice divided into 4 quarters so....he can eat 2 1/4 slices

2:3 and 2:1 Charmaine Tesha and Holly. Tesha has 4 cards more than Charmaine So 3x4 gives Tesha 12 cards, 2x4 gives Charmaine 8 cards which is 4 less than Tesha that would give Holly 1x6 because 12/6 is 2 the ratio of Tesha with Holly. which is 6 cards for Holly. 

Jo 3 hours to paint house and Sam 5... How many hours together. JO takes 1 hour to paint a 1/3 and 1 hour sam is 1/5 so together in 1 hour they paint 1/3+1/5 = 5+3= 8/15 or 16/30 to use more friendly of numbers.  In 1 hour they are over halfway done so they are going to take less than 2 hours. Infant it would be 2 hours and 7/15 of an hour so equivalent fractions tell me 8/15 in one hour 1/15 shy of two hours....x4 so I want to say 4 minutes shy of 2 hours....I'm going with 1 hour and 56 minutes though I'm not sure about my thinking on 56 minutes. It's 11pm sorry :)>
385:<I responded before the video that I thought the kids would say they enjoyed math class because they were able to talk and share their ideas (and their ideas were then validated)... listening to the three boys, it is incredibly refreshing to hear / see they DO see math this way = it's free to think and share ideas! The teacher clearly set up classroom-culture for that kind of learning to take place, which - for the kids - feels natural. It was interesting to hear them articulate the difference between this year with Nick and the years before = so they DO notice a difference :) When given a voice, safe space to talk (we make mistakes, we all do), and the invitation to openly and actively participate, learning shifts to be an experience shared rather than a prescribed directive.>
386:<I want my students to be excited, to persevere, to inquire being creative and inquisitive. I will give it the acronym CIIPE. I think in an inquiry setting these things happen, and when you see them as a person who is passionate for math, it sparks a smile and ignites a spark, sends a powerful beat in the heart like a great big YES! I got them. 

Math is exciting, it is fun, it is personal and when, through inquiry, students feel this, they are hooked into math. So in saying that I don't want my students to be these, but it has to happen to keep my fire ignited :)>
387:<Dear Jo,
thank you very much for the course! I hope something like this will be taught to all future teachers as well as  Math content. Unfortunately a lot of Math teachers don't feel comfortable with content , and as a result can not afford allowing students to go their ways. I believe the crises we have now is a result of  poor preparation of teachers in college where  subject area is not a focus as funny as it sounds.  It is even more true for elementary teachers. 'I became elementary teacher because I was bad in Math at school" - I hear it frustratingly often!
Thank you again and will be looking forward for new classes :-)>
388:<I'm gonna totally steal that idea!!! 

;)>
389:<These three children clearly loved their math lessons... and their teacher!  I was impressed that they had the confidence to use the terminology to describe what they were doing.

I love that they said math was "free".  That was a delightful statement.

I was surprised that they called their teacher "Nick". ;)>
390:<I really like this b/c it uses math symbolism in the message :) Nice job.>
391:<Leave it to 7th graders to try to figure out a way of outsmarting the system :) --- Maybe they can be challenged to discuss how things could go wrong on particular tasks they are completing - so as to grow their brain in that sense - what kinds of mistakes could happen when we work on this task?>
392:<I thought math was all about rigid rules that were not to be broken! :)>
393:<Quantum mechanics, and the quantisation it entails, suggests that whole numbers are an intrinsic part of the fabric of reality, and I would posit that perhaps they may even be more real than what we consider to be real. :-) I recommend another online course that I'm currently taking: "BerkeleyX: CS-191x Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation".>
394:<That sound interesting, can you explain it? :)>
395:<Great video, thanks for sharing.  Love Ted Talks :-)>
396:<I like your emphasis on using mistakes as "guides" in learning. Mistakes = Guides that gets brains growing.  :)>

398:<Liked the way you teach. It is clear that your students experince the joy of learning just by watching you. May be we should consider the process of enjoyment as something "learnable" :)>
399:<This video is very similar to "Quick Images" activities that I use when teaching using the Ivestigations Curriculum. We follow the same format as Math Talks, and students get to share the methods and strategies they use to find a sum or product. This process helps students to articulate their math processes, and to build;d confidence at explaining their reasoning. It is extremely helpful in building number sense, and seeing spatial relationships. The kids love it.>
400:<Me too. Totally agree. One way to do it is to get stuck in with Formative Assessment :)>
401:<Neat idea!   (Hey, it helpsthe adults do all those things, too :))>
402:<Awesome poster!  Love it!  =)>
403:<Yes- that poster has new meaning now!  Brains at work.. Be Aware:  Mistakes are common and a welcome way to learn! =)>
404:<I have great sympathy for the challenges of teaching a diverse group of kids, but I think the fixed mindset imposed includes a mindset that a certain amount of material must be plowed through with the teacher doing all the teaching. I think it is very powerful when a student that "gets it" has the opportunity to express their thinking - how they worked a problem and worked through whatever difficulties. The examples of "flipping the classroom" may seem extreme to some folks as well, but there are elements of that approach that allows classroom time to be spent in inquiry and offers more opportunity to discuss and share. When a student has an opportunity to "teach" that is a challenge that isn't normally available, and if the parents are pushing for challenge for their gifted-talented, I would think that would cover it. Not only will it deepen the students understanding who hear the presentation, the student "teaching" will see more insights from articulating his/her process. [Jake Barnett is an autistic boy who is I think 13 now, and a student of astrophysics at Indiana U; I saw him draw out about 70 zeros to show his brothers the benefits of scientific notation; he seems to be a natural teacher :-)]>
405:<I like this idea a lot!  I want to use it in my classroom :)  I like the brainstorm carousel on chart paper, it helps students both contribute their ideas while also reading other people's.  I like to do it in silence or with music in the background, to create a kind of sacredness to the exercise.>
406:<The boys loved math, because "there is freedom, you can do anything." What a great way to see math and numbers! I do not think the students realize that math could be taught differently. They just thought that's what you learn when you are a third grader. You need to know it before going to fourth grade.  

This is so inspiring! :)>
407:<That was awesome! I will be stealing:)>
408:<I wasnt really surprised by the responses of the students but excited to see how they thought the way I had expected them to feel after participating in the math talks. I thought they would feel free to make their own decisions, and there would be less pressure to come up with the "right way" to do things. Very impressed with their ease in making mistakes and ability to have others help them. GREAT SECTION!! :)>
409:<I was thinking I would open with the fact we learned that successful people make MORE mistakes. Hopefully that will take some of the fear of "doing it wrong" away. Then we can talk about the positive effects that making a mistake and going through the process of learning from a mistake has. We can talk about how everyone makes mistakes and that mistakes are process, perhaps using the quote (paraphrased and probably misattributed to Edison) "I have not failed; I have merely found 10,000 ways that don't work."
<br>
We could also go over the MISTAKES poster I made earlier, and talk about mistakes we've made in our lives (mathematical and otherwise) and how they have helped us learn and grow as people.
 <br> 
We would then talk about my positive feelings about mistakes, and how I like it when my students make mistakes because then I know they are learning and I can use those mistakes to help other students learn. I can also ask them to be positive about the mistakes their peers make, remembering that mistakes help not only the person having them (better than if no mistake was made) but also those around them who can take the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of their friends, too.
<br>
Hopefully all of this will create a comfortable culture of mistake-making in my classroom, so that students are able to take risks freely and make mistakes positively. :)>
410:<This is a new school year, new friends, new books, new teacher and new learning skills, lets start with talking about mistakes...Mistakes are helpful, how many of you knew that? Mistakes are our friends, how many of you knew that already? We will be doing a lot of challening work, for math we will not have any timed math, we will have Challening math meaning you will work at your own pace to make sure you get it and understand it, you will have gone through several materials by the end of the year which we will have a test. Lets have fun, have a great year and lets get busy and learn :)>
411:<First off, I was surprised that they called their teacher "Nick".  (In my day, I would have been sent to the Principal's Office for that... :-)

Seriously though, I was surprised that they recognized that mistakes were good things, and that they enjoyed playing with the numbers.  They knew that this was going to be valuable down the road.>
412:<Thank you for the great online experience, and for all the effort and time put into this course.  I value everything that you have shared, and I am excited to implement more enquiry based math project in my class this fall.  Thanks for offering possibilities for continued support too :-)>
413:<(and I am)
I showed the math teacher I'm collaborating with, who doesn't have time to take this course, the "dot card" video.  To my delight, she did that exercise. (It will just so happen that I will pull up choice videos every time we get together. LOVE LOVE LOVE taht they are of a length that a certifiable ADD teacher with "no time" can watch.)  
   And, whereas, I cranked out the course because now the semester has begun and I'm tutoring, collaborating, and taking CSC 140 -- Computer Science I (Java), now I am not satisfied with Completing the Assignment.   Now I am feeling a need to find at least three *different*ways of doing each assignment and commenting the hekc out of them :-)>
414:<I just responded and poof it vanished, but again, I teach on this level and try to show my students that math is doable and that with work and effort (and a good teacher :))everybody can work up the ladder.  I find this gives students hope.  The trouble is that most adults have so many demands on their time that it's hard to give the time needed to study.>
415:<ahh but were you able to convince him of this? ;)>
416:<The kids were delightful - "everyone makes mistakes" and "math is so open" were my favorite lines. :)>
417:<I am glad you are in this class getting this information. You may enjoy watching some of the YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkYFw4qQUsw&list=PLsilMSaqafYi-GL5o672_Ig8Pu_dShwnY that are from a recent conference on Dyslexia and Talent ---
I've been thinking a lot about the "how does this shape grow" problem presented earlier in the course and how I could deploy this with kids to help them see patterns. I thought of one exercise that you may find helpful -- my daughter is ten and totally loves "thought experiments" that have to do with her stuffed animals -- so we have a party and they all "happen to like beans" so we have to decide about how many each animal would like, since they are all different sizes and eat different amounts, so we could play this out by getting a 1 or 2 lb bag of dried beans and letting her separate the amounts she thinks would be sufficient in different piles, then that leads to a discussion about different ways of getting to different amounts..(we could even image bigger animals not in the group she has that would need even bigger amounts)..I also tell her when I'm taking a class (I'm a librarian so she knows I'm always into finding stuff) and that I need a kid's perspective on how to be more flexible in my own thinking (she loves that and is happy to help when I put myself in the learner's position)...>
418:<I was already sold, but now I am really sold.  Math is cool, free, fun?  when I make a mistake everyone can help me fix it? decompose, friendly numbers...
This is the attitude I hope that the people of the future have, and I'm sure it extends beyond math into other areas. 
I suppose there is hope for the future :)>
419:<Did you get it wrong? don't worry :) even I do this, this is a very typical mistake

or:  If you make a mistake don't worry we are here to practice and learn.  Lets reflect about it so we try again>
420:<I also loved the idea of math being free that others mentioned. It really surprised me because math is always thought of as constrictive. Their whole mentality to math is more positive than I have ever seen! Their understanding of math basics, like the properties of numbers surpasses even mine (and other adults I am sure) in some ways! how will I ever send my kiddos to a school/teacher that doesn't grasp this?! ;)>
421:<$0.10 (a) + $0.12 (p) 
where a=apples in pounds
p=pears in pounds>
422:<Want to grow your brain?  Think outside the box!  There IS no box!  Brains grow from figuring out challenges and making MANY, MANY mistakes!  Let's get those neurons fired up! Extra credit for mistakes!  :)>
423:<I find your issues real and I share your view. I'll try to use open-ended, inquiry based problems to set the stage of the concepts we are forced to teach by law. 
I hope this will have two good effects:

 1. Enhance problem solving skills for students
 2. Increase their engagement to math

After that I'll give them more traditional problems, etc.
Were these two goals be reached, I'd be already on my way to teaching happiness :)>
424:<Agreed!  "Math is free" should be the new catch phrase in every math class:)>
425:<I share my enthusiasm for learning . . .  that we are continue to learn in all areas. . . how to write, read better. . . how to predict more keenly . . . and that indeed, your brain matter GROWS!  I began drawing a graphic of the brain . . . showed errors. . . bigger brain!  Yahoo. . . Kids were jazzed.  (Side note:  I share with the kids that I make purposeful errors in front of them everyday . . throughout the day . . .  debrief to myself :)  what I might try differently. . . . model making mistakes . . . brainstorm verbally how I possibly solve my error. . . I demo. . giggling about it. . .  I want mistakes to NOT have a negative, ignorant connotation . . but I want them to be viewed as stepping stones in learning.>
426:<Please: I ask any one who is considering flipping the classroom to watch this video. It is 10 - 15 minutes long, but very, very important you take to heart the message here. Even Khan himself has a video out now PROMOTING this approach.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CHoXRvGTtAQ>
427:<Although I am not a teacher, I will consider sharing this online course directly to my friends who need to study mathematics on their own like I do.

The content provided by this course is so useful that we know from so many perspectives on how to learn the real mathematics. I believe it's not only useful for teacher and parents of kid, but also useful for the mature-self-learner like myself and my friends.

I will expecially recommend them to rethink about mistakes and change their mind from fixed into growing. And show them how research show the positive evidence by doing the same. Simply the message I would say is that "take this course" :)>
428:<i used a combination of methods as well.  i wasn't sure about any of the answers that i submitted but i did enjoy doing the math with my new mindset.  in reviewing the correct answer, i have learned some new things but i can't say that i am able to compress anything yet :-)>
429:<I love the Edison quote!
I shall share this with my High School students also, it is not only for "Lower Schoolers"  :)>
430:<It is very interesting how much the process is praised over the correctness of the answer.  I also appreciated how positive she was! :)>
431:<As soon as one student said they enjoy "decomposing" the numbers, I thought, wow, they even know what it's called! Aside from this, I thought it was great that the students were so enthusiastic in how they were learning math. I also thought it was wonderful that one student said, "...sometimes we make mistakes, but everyone makes mistakes," and reminded me that not only is discussion great from learning reasons, but students also realize that everyone makes mistakes and it is completely okay if they do. It seems that Nick really got his lesson across -- that students are allowed to decompose and regroup numbers in math class. This method also allows room for students to have some control over their work, and they feel the sense of freedom in decomposing and regrouping in however way they choose. :)>
432:<I like this! :)>
433:<Love it! :)>
434:<If I'd known we could use any operators, I would have defined 20 operators C_1 to C_20 such that for the i-th operator, C_i(x) = i ... :-)

If you assume only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, then you can show that only 1-9, 12, 16 and 20 can be constructed.>
435:<How awesome! :)>
436:<it's good clean fun play!!  very inspiring :)>
437:<Is it possible to collate responses from participants, the best ones, for all questions for a kind of resource for all of us? This would be a great international collaborative resource. :)>
438:<Hi Jo,
The course was really informative especially the information about growth mind set!
I am a homeschooler and was wondering if you can recommend resources for inquiry based math curriculum for elementary and middle school, please!

Thanks!

439:<Kids have a tendency to think that whatever way the teacher answers the question is the best or correct way to answer and if the student thought differently they will think their method is not effective or that it is even wrong.  By sharing different methods or approaches a child can see that there are many different ways of doing math effectively and finstead of feeling that they did it the wrong way they will feel validated that their way was an acceptable way (because there is clearly more than one way of answering) and they may feel encouraged to try seeing numbers/problems differently instead of defending their thought process. And the brilliant icing on the cake, is that the teacher can facilitate a conversation that students will draw these conclusions from instead of telling them the conclusion which will make many students more receptive (some don't mind just being told :)>
440:<I thought that the boys were saying that they enjoy manipulating maths components...I loved that they enjoy 'decomposing' - like taking a toy car apart :D and then hopefully putting it (or something else) together again - like playing with lego....>
441:<I like your intentional mistake (four) :-)>
442:<Thank you for this quick and positive feedback :)>
443:<Yes, do it.  For ideas read:

 - 'Mindset' by Carol Dweck 
 - 'How children succeed'by Paul Tough
 - 'Bounce' by Matthew Syed
 - 'Talent is overrated' by Geoff Colvin
 - Better by mistake' by Alina Tugend.

:)>
444:<I have always had the notion that there is more than one way to get an answer to an equation.  But never imagined the multiple ways one could picture 10 from the dot card.  This really shows that we can all be different in our thinking and still get the correct answer.

I am going to play with this tomorrow. :)>
445:<I totally agree with your comment. In the 8 years that I've taught math I've never used the word free to describe the work that we do...maybe this needs to change ;)>
446:<I agree. I know Jo really tried hard to avoid leading questions, but I did pick up a few, such as do you think how it is taught makes a difference. I don't think the kids picked up on it being a teaching strategy until the word "taught" was used. Then it was somewhat suggested that Nick's role is important. We as adults know Nick's methods are relatively unique, but the kids really don't. By 3rd grade they have only had 2 other teachers, possibly 3 if they went to K. I would like to see a carefully structured interview of students exposed to this method - a pre/post evaluation - to see if it changes their minds on math. I have seen very able math students say they don't like math, so it was very encouraging to see that these kids did like math! :)>
447:<My son is a **huge** NASCAR fan, thank you so much for this problem that I'll save for when he launches into Algebra. I won't say it's from Penske though since he's a Hendrick fan ;)>
448:<I found them casually using the word 'decompose numbers' very surprising for 3rd graders. Fun ,cool are OK ,heard them many times but decompose has a nice nuance to it :-)>
449:<I also was positively surprised to hear them describe math as free!  How different learning math would be if everyone thought that:)>
450:<I had this same thinking and logic questioning going on my problem solving.  So, I thought that Jo paints 1/3 of a house each day and Sam paints 1/5.  So, using a common denominator of 15 they could paint 16/15 of a house in 2 days.  So, figuring that they might still slow each other a little bit even being adults, it should take 2 days:)>
451:<Estimating must be why my diets never quite last!  I figured 1/9# each so the dieter could eat 2 pieces and a bite or so of 3rd:)>
452:<What jumped out to me most was that they said math is FREE, you can DO WHAT YOU WANT. Somehow I hadn't thought about math that way, but now I do. :-)>
453:<I was surprised they called him Nick :).   I was not surprised that they liked it so much.  It was a little surprising that they seemed to understand what a good way of teaching this was.  They really seemed to grasp that they were learning more this way.  I loved it when the one boy kept on saying that it was freeing.>
454:<First i saw the kids playing with the numbers :
8x9x3=24x9=24x3x3=6x4x3x3=6x12x3=18x12= =dead-end , 
because the next kid found the result from the beginning :
8x9x3=72x3=70x3+2x3=210+6=216 .
Anyway the purpose of the procedure was the kids to have fun while they are learning maths ( come closer to number sense.)>
455:<:) I could help but enjoy your comment!>
456:<I was really impressed by the students vocabulary usage (decompose, friendly numbers, etc;).  Plus they seemed to have a lot of enthusiasm for Math, and it seems that they were certain that the way they were learning now would help them in their future years.  There was so much positivity for Math--really impressive.>
457:<Wonderful poster!! Thank you for sharing; I'll put it up in my classroom:)>
458:<Sort of like Math is Play:)... what fun!>
459:<Big Idea was also to help make maths practical and applicable to life ie working out portion sizes rather than a structured and formal.
Small idea - learn the basics.  Agree with you there too! :)>
460:<Hi!  I have found this class extremely valuable and want to provide it to the teachers in the Lewiston School District.  Are the components going to be available after the course has ended?  I'm wondering about the interesting questions Jo asks prior, during, and after her video clips as well as the actual video clips????  It is my hope that we will be able to pass on this knowledge to our colleagues.
Please .... please .... please say "Yes, it will be made available!"
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.  :)
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
461:<All too often when I see a cool idea that I want to start using in my middle grade classrooms I jump in head first and expect things to go as smoothly as they did when I either saw them done or participated in them! With this example of the dot cards as a beginning step to working with number talks, students would have the chance to practice the process before the math was challenging. The teacher can use something like this to lay the groundwork for how number talks are used, how the discussions flow, how students need to be clear when explaining their thinking, and how connections can be made throughout a variety of methods. I'm looking forward to trying out a dot card number talk later this week :)>
462:<Sounds like a good idea :)  Let us know how it turns out.  I agree with you that I was tracked as gifted and bored if I wasn't in an advanced class.  What we really need is to unschool completely.  Schools should be completely open and optional, so the students can choose to enroll only in topics that they are actually wanting to learn and ready to learn.  Then all learning will take place quickly and efficiently and painlessly.  It's a matter of choice.  Of course, this doesn't mean that some people won't struggle with their learning.  A lot of people enjoy doing things that they aren't necessarily good at.  But if you enroll people of different ages and abilities in a class, like a knitting class, the more experienced and talented of the group will automatically become additional peer teachers who help the newcomers.  That is what real learning should always look like.  You got your grannies sitting next to the new mommies next to the teenagers.  Why should math be any different?>
463:<Sounds good to me :)  I'm looking at what learning looked like before we started compulsory education, the great social experiment, only about 150 years ago in the US.  I don't know why in a few short generations, we have all forgotten how to learn and how to teach.  Learning is supposed to be fun, not work.  Teaching is a social thing.  You can learn things by yourself, too, but most people like to have someone else who's good at something show them.  Take our minds out of the school box, and imagine how Alice might have learned her lessons before she fell into her Wonderland daydream.  What happened to our apprenticeships?  What happened to having lunch with your family?  Society has gone terribly awry in taking children away from their families and putting them in institutions to learn to "socialize" with each other.  How did people ever learn to be social and have manners before school came along?>
464:<Works for me!  :)>
465:<I agree. I love how they thought of mistakes as positive things, and they seemed to feel like they had the secret key to math success for 4th grade and beyond :).>
466:<Back in the day, when I was in school :), I remember vividly being in the "high" math group.  Sure, this helped me, but what did it do for the other students in the "middle" and "low" groups?  Fast forward 30 years.  I have been teaching for 22 years - from K-8, "regular" ed to special ed.  I am currently at a school that chose to ability group the students this year.  I was against it from the start (and still am), but I was overruled.  I guess I should have done some extra homework to find the studies on ability grouping...sigh.  It's hard enough to get teachers "off the textbook" and have their students THINK.  Now I see it's even MORE important because of the way my school set up the classes.>
467:<This is the youtube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc>
468:<It was surprising to hear how much "FUN" they are having in math class now!  They are not stressed or anxious at all !!!!! :)>
469:<Thanks!  I didn't use sqrt or ! and that would explain my gaps :D>
470:<1 4  7 10 
slope is 3
3x - 2
for case 100 298

i do caution students about overgeneralization
and ask them to pls never say never and never say always ;)>
471:<Mistakes are the portals of discovery, we learn best after we go back after our mistakes and think about the problem. Mistakes are encouraged in this classroom, if you make a mistake be proud of yourself for taking a risk and know you are only benefitting yourself. :) Take your time, we all learn best when we have time to think about our answers.>
472:<The students seemed very excited about math and being able to use whatever method they wanted to solve the problems. They felt it was free and they could talk about it and get help by seeing what others were thinking. They felt that everybody makes mistakes and by talking about their thinking it would help them to correct their mistakes and help them with their homework later. I loved hearing the math vocabulary they have learned with the words: decompose, break it down, and using friendly numbers. They could explain what these meant and used them often when solving problems. They felt empowered to be successful with their math. Very cute too :)>
473:<I agree.  I am inspired by the students thinking that math is free!  They also mentioned so many different strategies they have learned to use to make math "freer" for them - I'd like for someone to interview my students and have them say the same.  We're just seven days into the school year in my neck of the woods, that's going to be a goal for me this year! :-)>
474:<Is this considered an equation or more of a number sentence?
TC=(#a x 10¢) + (#p x 12¢)

If TC = Total Cost, a=apple, p=pear>
475:<There is largely a "setting" system in place at my high school.There is a "top-set" and a "Support" set in every year group and then the remaining classes are "mixed'. The interesting thing is, that I find I need to differentiate every lesson (I have at least one of each of the above classes). I do not have one class where "everyone's at the same place all the time". Every student comes with a different understanding and the best bit is when we start a topic and we find out what everyone else knows. I love the fact that I don't have classes of robots! The hard part to come to terms with, is the idea that these kids "know their set", so they would be receiving messages about their ability from the "setting", but hopefully not from my teaching and their learning :).>
476:<To hear the say math is free- you can do what you want to solve a problem. they were all able to use math vocabulary such as decomposing and friendly numbers when they gave examples which shows that they use them to explain their thinking. This sounds like the first  year this has been opened to them - the idea that math is free.They sound like confident math problem solvers. I chuckled when i heard them talk about making mistakes and others can help you solve the problem so you have to do less work. I know MANY students like that! :)>
477:<I totally agree -- well stated.  
My response was:  [In addition to your idea or another day, you might ask:]
What is brainstorming?  How does it work?  
Today's brainstorm:  When you cannot figure something out, what can other people say or do to help you?  [Have the students write their ideas on a big class chart in web format with "Help Me" in the center.]>
478:<Wow - to hear elementary students describe math as something "free" that they get to do makes it sound like they won the lottery!!!  They seemed thrilled to be able to use different strategies.  They also used good vocabulary, like "decomposing".  I think these students will continue to be very successful in math classes in their future (as they pointed out in not so many words at the end:) )>
479:<It surprised me that they described math as free. I would have like to hear more about that comment. Also, they call the teacher Nick, that is interesting to me but not about math:) wonderful comment about being comfortable making mistakes.>
480:<It was interesting to hear that they felt that math taught in this way was "free".  They could remember that math was not always taught this way (maybe not in 1st grade?), but they seemed confused when they were asked if they knew that sometimes math is taught in a way that there is only one way to get an answer.  This was not even in their frame of reference.  That is AWESOME!  :-)>
481:<I like this, not only does it use something from the videos, but it helps with some new vocab - a little interdisciplinary subject matter! :)>
482:<It also delays getting the answer immediately. They will have to wait to figure out what a synapse is. Maybe they will get a synopsis about synapses :-)   Yeah mistakes!>
483:<Sebastian said ''And math to me is just a training course to be a citizen, how to think in the world''.
Sarah said ''math=puzzle''
I think is bought because use some logic and axioms, propositions, lemmas and theorems previously learned to solve math problems and the everyday life.>
484:<Students get these from parents or others who have had poor experiences in Maths or who have gained those beliefs themselves. Usually craved into desks or toilet walls :)>
485:<Dot cards are a great way of explaining to students that one visual can be seen from many perspectives. This also clearly helps students  understand that there are many ways to solve a math problem. I personally began to see many more perspectives as the students began talking... a brain growth moment:)>
486:<Nice. I am joining your class :)>
487:<I have loved this course so far and am getting a lot of good information.  However, this is the first item I beg to differ on.  I encourage my students to use letters that better represent the item that they are using.  I make them write out what each variable stands for at the beginning of each problem.

The first time I tell them that they can choose "better" letters than 'x' and 'y', I can see the light bulb go on.  I have had very few problems with students using "first letter variables" and misunderstanding what they actually mean.

I would be interested in seeing the research that shows this is a bad thing.

Thanks for the course!!  Back to Daniel and his grandma now  :-)>
488:<I think one of the first things that really struck me from watching this video was when the boy on the left said he likes to "decompose numbers." I was really impressed by their mathematical vocabulary and their advanced level of thinking. You could tell that their teacher had created an environment in the classroom where students felt safe to share ideas with one another, and making mistakes was expected and okay! I'm going to jump on the bandwagon with most of the others in this forum as well that we are all shocked that these students look at math as freedom. They see it as an opportunity to solve problems multiple ways, and share their ideas with one another. I loved how they made a point to say that often all of the students in the class have a different answer and they enjoy sharing them. I've never heard any children in 3rd grade talk this way about math. I want the teacher's secrets! :)>
489:<i want to ask the kids how they feel when they make mistakes and ask them why they feel that way?  i think a lot of it has to do w/ peers.  in my classroom i want people to feel comfortable in making mistakes and having ideas and opinions.  that's making fun of and putting down someone is not acceptable.  then go into how mistakes make our brain grow.  asking questions makes our brain grow.  That all of "you" (my students) will grow a bigger brain this year, whether you like or not :)>
490:<Let’s work together this year to help each other understand and enjoy math! Let’s learn from our mistakes as we grow our brain together, and make connections to understand how to solve problems in our everyday life, and to reach our learning goals. We will not be afraid to learn math together, learn at our own pace, and help each other with corrections and connections! :)>
491:<This year with my kindergarten students I introduced the idea that mistakes make our brain grow the first time I had a student make a mistake in front of the class. It was fun to hear the students talking a little later... I heard things like, "Teacher! I made a mistake! :)">
492:<I am hearing all thoughts, and we all agree that it really is what do the variables represent.  Do you know that we used to all write that out a=apples, p=pears, etc.  I don't remember exactly when algebra stopped requiring students to think about that!>
493:<I know, right..:)>
494:<It was also interesting to hear how much they used the word decomposing. :)>
495:<I would show "The Roses of Success" song from *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang* movie, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GND10sWq0n0 and explain that mistakes should be embraced and are encouraged...  then as the children are quite young, we would sing the song together :-)>
496:<Interesting idea. :) I like it.>
497:<I would show my students videos on how neurons work and what happens in our brains when we are generating "new knowledge" or developing new neuron connections. I would tell them that every time we make a mistake, we are generating new brain connections and we are getting smarter. So... more mistakes = more learning :D>
498:<I was thinking along the same lines, but with the added twist of making a mistake in front of the class (purposefully) explaining that we really ALL do make mistakes & it's OK...we're learning.  :)>
499:<I love the ideas I have read here. I already have some quotes written down about mistakes I have heard during this course to make into a poster. I would like to make some sort of visual of the bridges being built in the brain to introduce to the students the growth of the brain when we make mistakes. I have already told my students this year about that and they are using the vocabulary from that. One wrote on a paper recently that they are learning to be happier when they make mistakes because they know they are building a connection in their brain. :-)>
500:<I was really surprised like mentioned before about the usage of vocabulary..... As well as about the positive thoughts towards math....these boys really enjoy math :)>
501:<I wonder what they say about making mistakes when it is just them.  The question seemed a little leading (I am guilty of this too!  My inflection is my biggest downfall :)) so I wonder if it feels as positive as they are saying.  I could tell Nick has probably done a lot to help the students to be okay with mistakes, but there are still so many parts of students days that are about why mistakes are bad, so I wonder how students negotiate that in their minds.>
502:<I don't think it's going to be enough to tell my kids that mistakes are okay.  I know  they would want to believe (because I'm the teacher and they're young enough), but their experiences have already told them that mistakes are not okay.  I need to create a culture where mistakes are valued and examined--in the classroom, on the playground, in the cafeteria, etc.  I'm sure at first they'll think I'm nuts, but if I'm consistent, I think they'll be enthusiastic participants. :)>
503:<Used what i learnt in my class blog :)

504:<I would like to share with kids or students, how every experience that we have in this life, is a valuable one. How we can learn from our mistakes, and of the mistakes that others make. And how we can also learn from getting things right. How all the ways are OK. How there is never a wrong way. How it is safe to make mistakes and learn from them. It will all turn out well in the end anyway :)
I would support them in finding and cultivating curiosity within, and also imagining and using their imagination. And having as much fun along the way as possible :)>
505:<I see no reason not to, and afterwards you can have interesting discussions about what he learns :) Good luck!>
506:<I was particularly pleased with the comments about being FREE - you can do whatever you want!  Sounded like they were in an art class - not math class :)

And their comfort with making a mistake, and not having to do more problems :)  How often do we make students complete repetition to reinforce a concept when they may have simply "made a mistake"...>
507:<Also great for cooperative learning and brainstorming! Sounds like fun:)>
508:<Hi everyone, I am just wondering if this course will be running next year? I joined very late as I am wrapping up another degree and teaching full time. My twitter handle is @scu006 and I do a lot of enrichment projects with primary students in Australia. If someone knows can you please let me know :)

Cheers

510:<I said to myself "40 minus 3 so 37.  However, then I actually counted and found there were 36."  Oopps. :)>
511:<You bring up very valid points.  We really don't cut deli slices into fractional parts, unless you are on a diet that is :)>
512:<My surprise too. 
I have never think that math is free. More on the other side: there's all kind of rules :))>
513:<Stress the following dispositions:

1. How to feed your brain (and make it happy:)) in math class:

 - Welcome mistakes
 - Make mistakes
 - Learn from mistakes


2."Using Errors as Springboards for the Learning of Mathematics"

514:<These boys obviously love what they are doing in their math class this year. There teacher Nick has given them the freedom and permission to think about solutions, even if they are not 100% accurate.

Do you like math? Yeah, its free you can do whatever you want! You can break it down do multiplication, subtraction.

All the ideas of how you can do it. Probably the ways Nick taught us. Its really cool. There are 3 or 4 ways of doing it but people just don’t think about it.
:)

Do you think math talks helps? it helps because you see what others think and compare it to what you think. It tells us that people make mistakes and where we make them.>
515:<Hi Jo.

When you are looking for project based lessons, and you are a new teacher like my self, where do you begin?  I have some creativity, but not a strength in math.  I am teaching multiplying by powers of 10 to 15 ESL students who are struggling.  First, my lesson bombed yesterday, so I own that.  However, I was sitting her thinking that they were not engaged, hence the bad lesson, and wanted to know where I would start.  OR is it that I have to base my project more on the standard and less on the individual topics?

Help.

Thank you for holding this class and continuing to support us struggling math teachers.  ;)

I am not sure how to communicate with you after we don't have access to this course anymore.  Can you respond to email?

Have a great day!

516:<I find it fascinating how when one feels free to use numbers and play with them and have fun with them, then suddenly math becomes fun, too :)>
517:<This has been my favorite video yet (although I say that about every one of them, practically). I am going to use the WT Thurston as an extra credit reflection assignment for my students tomorrow :)>
518:<I also need to add, regarding this segment, that I too always felt I was cheating when I would arrive at an answer in a different way from standard algorithm!! (Before Sophie's video segment i actually wrote that in my class notes). How mind opening and validating to see people coming to answers in many different ways. :)>
519:<Thank you so much for your answer!!! =)>
520:<This is the exact dilemma I am having in my classroom right now. How do I teach all my students when tests have shown them to range from 2nd to 9th grade levels. We are a huge "intervention" school since we are Title 1. We pull kids out of electives for extra math and have a mandatory tutoring hour (where  the non tutoring kids get to play games and do fun things). I can't control this. I can only control my classroom (to an extent). What I'm realizing is that I have been failing to differentiate at all. And all these other teachers and parents ARE right, it's hard. It's to change tasks, assessments, and mindsets, too, but we've got to figure out how to do it. Right now I suppose I'm reconsidering my in class intervention plan, wondering if I should still target groups of kids who have been deemed "in need of intervention"... so essentially- I'm lost and in survival mode. :)>
521:<I loved hearing that math is free and you can do what you want!  I also was happy to hear that sometimes we make mistakes but everyone makes mistakes. :)>
522:<I've already started the year asking the question, "who here would like to have a bigger brain by June?"  My kids, who are ESL all looked shocked by my question put their hands up.  I explained how mistakes create two synapses (drew the brain and zaps on the whiteboard) to make the connections stronger and the brain grow bigger...and that's why I like mistakes. I also added, if I choose you, it may be bc we can all learn from your mistake.  I use the "bzzz' sound to symbolize brain growth, the kids know is and use it too :)>
523:<By bringing the 24-pack of tokens to lost-and-found, and then they can split them =)>
524:<Hi, 
Will we be able to access the website when the course is finished? I'd like to be able to review some videos and also access the wiki. 

Apologies if this question has already been answered. :)
Thanks.>
525:<:-)>
526:<There is nothing better than cooking to get kids to see how real maths is :)>
527:<I discovered this course late in the game, started the first unit, and then life got in the way ;)
Is there a possibility of accessing the archived lessons and materials as professional learning, without the certificate component?
The videos I did watch were excellent.>
