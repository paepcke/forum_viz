0:<Hello everyone! I'm here mostly here for the math and physics in the "refresher" resources, since they seem to cover the same prerequisites that Circuits and Electronics on edX, and my circuits class on college, need (Of course I will study them at a deeper level, in fact I'm doing so in college, but I have a circuits class on the first semester for reasons beyond my understanding and need to get a quick working knowledge of the math and physics I'll need). I don't know whether I'll get to the actual point of the course, quantum mechanics, though I'll certainly try :P>
1:<What did you want to calculate? :)

2:<I disagree. E.g. if temperature is "increasing with a constant rate" then the rate of the increase is a constant such as 5K/s, i.e. constant derivative of the temperature rather than a constant derivative of its increase. But English is only my third language, so I would not argue too much. In fact, just wanted to say Hi to Marc :) -<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
3:<And it's driving me nuts!  :)>
4:<I agree.  I've had similar experience in another MOOC.  SO much time wasted wondering about and resolving typos, possible typos, and less careful wording of problems.

Course designers generally overestimate the ease and quality of interaction via "Discussion".  It just ain't the same as being in the same room.  In the same room, so many of these little confusions get resolved so quickly and readily that course staff don't even know they were there.  Designers don't have any idea how much work goes into "rework" to compensate for sloppy (forgive me) wordsmanship in quizes/homeworks/tests.

(Another thing we can do in a real room is avoid the jerks.  In a "Discussion", the jerks never go away!  :-)  )>

7:<Nicky, the biggest problem I have with MOOCs is not enough time to work on all the interesting ones. I took the U of Maryland EQP course last spring. I made it through, but had to drop everything else except one other course that was just ending at the time (QMQC). At present, I'm taking Lewin's Classical Mechanics, Murayama's Big Bang to Dark Energy (only 4 weeks), and Tomkin's Intro Sustainability. 

Mark, good to see you on another QM MOOC.

I've looked at the first set of lectures in this course and enjoy the philosophical commentary, but look forward to getting into the math as well. I enjoyed reading Mark's comments and Prof. Miller's positive response. I picked up the text for this class and hope there's a close correspondence between it and the content.

9:<I don't feel bad at all for not paying for this course because if it were not free, i probably would have been unable to pay for it. Unless they asked for peanuts as fees! :P

But you are right. So much effort has been put into creating this course and i personally found it excellent. So yes, i wouldn't mind paying a nominal sum.>

To change my momentum, I must either slow down or speed up (assuming my mass stays constant).

13:<Same here . . .trying to restart a rusty brain. Seems most of the physics I used to know got formatted and overwritten.
Ambiguous questions will really test your understanding of the subject. Let's hope the course material presented will justify the level of questions. I hate getting it wrong because I misunderstood the question.
The course material here should be challenging enough that the tutor does not have to resort to "trick" questions for assessments. We should do bad enough without trick questions ;)>

15:<I think QUIZ 1.2.3 Q2 may have an error in it. I'm not sure to what extent are we allowed to specify the answers, but I've checked several times, but keep getting one answer that is counted as true to actually be false. It looks just like there's a slight misprint in the units...

Also, would it be possible to see the correct answers after submitting the homework problems, as well? I apparently got one wrong (even after 3 allowed attempts), but embarrassingly I still don't understand what I did wrong. It's Assignment 1 Q6, second part of the question, in case anyone else is having trouble with this one. Learning from your own mistakes is very effective, but only as long as you know how to correct yourself afterwards. :)

Otherwise cheers, I am enjoying this course. David Miller is a good lecturer.>

20:<Thank you very much for the explanation! I made the bad mistake of *looking* for the general form (which may be hidden under mathematical manipulations, and not actually solving the differential equation with the given expression. :)>
21:<In the classical wave equation derivation (around 5:15 of 'The Classical Wave Equation' video),

    (y_(j+1) - 2y_j + y_(j-1)) / (delta z)^2

is simplified to

    del^2 y / del z^2

Where does this come from? There is no equation that describes `y`, so how do we know what its second partial derivative w.r.t `z` is?

**EDIT**: Ok, I think I've figured it out. This makes a lot more sense if you don't simplify the numerator in the previous step, which was originally:

    [(y_(j+1) - y_j) - (y_j + y_(j-1))]

The numerator is just `[delta y_j - delta y_(j-1)]`, which is `del^2 y`.

No idea why the numerator was simplified...it's so much easier to understand like this :)>
22:<I agree :)>
23:<Hi David, I think it would be a good idea to pin this thread (and the homework discussion forum thread) to the top of the discussion panel. Otherwise, they risk falling into disuse at the bottom of the threads pile :)>

25:<Of course! Thank you... :)>
26:<While our current discussion forum is centralized, would be great to set up subforums right underneath the videos too?

34:<[**start rant**]

So YOU, Stegosaur, DavidWales, and the 11 others who up-voters this embarrassing post, feel entitled, because you have this tiny little inconvenience to have to listen music that you don't particularly like and that costs you a few seconds of your very precious time, to demand from the course staff to go at great length to make changes to the material. The same course staff and world class professor that provide you, for free, with a top notch course, from which the level of rigor and attention for detail I haven't seen in a MOOC  on this subject thus far; actually in hardly any MOOC. The amount of work and time to put this course together must have been enormous.

But YOU, Stegosaur, DavidWales and other up-voters, you don't even feel the inclination to thank professor Miller and his team, before starting to complain and making demands, and express a tiny little appreciation for their hard work to enable you to 'consume'  this great course. For free.  And even if you think the course is not great -which it is - you should appreciate the effort that has been made to provide it to you lurkers. But rather the first thing you do, sitting on your lazy ***, hiding behind the anonymity of the internet,  is complaining about the music in the videos...

I don't know what went wrong in your education, but I hope you have better manners in "real life". But somehow I doubt it.

36:<thats the biggest thing Mr E explained i guess :)>
37:<Ok. Cheers! :)>
38:<Haha, didn't cross my mind, but strictly speaking you're definitely right, I guess. That would have been a real trick question if it was to be interpreted that (very literal) way :-).

A little reassurance: interpreting "probability" in the question as "probability density" earned me the green tick mark for this question.>
39:<Normalisation gives dimension to the wavefunction.

In a 1-D infinite well with width $L$, the wavefunction $psi(x)$ is normalised by a factor $A_{1D}propto sqrt{frac{1}{L}}$ so that $|psi_N(x)|^2$ has dimension $[L^{-1}]$ and the integral $int psi_N(x) dx$ is then dimensionless as a probablility should be.

For a 3-D infinite well with volume $L_x L_y L_z$, the wavefunction $psi(x,y,z)=psi(V)$ is normalised by a factor $A_{3D}propto sqrt{frac{1}{L_xL_yL_z}}$ so that $|psi_N(V)|^2$ has dimension $[L^{-3}]$ and the integral $int psi_N(V) dV$ is again dimensionless. 

So the dimension of the **normalised** 3-D wavefunction means that as well as being a probablility amplitude it can also be called a probability density.

The problem in A2Q7 is 1-D so this discussion of probability densities isn't strictly applicable to the question. 

I think the problem expressed by the original poster can be explained when the infinitesimal is applied in the integration of the probability amplitude. The particle is mathematically described as a point (i.e. having no length or volume) and in 1-D we can write the probability of finding the particle in the interval $Delta x$ as

$P(x in Delta x) = int_{Delta x} |psi(x)|^2 dx$

As $Delta x 	o 0$ (but $Delta x 
eq 0$) the interval becomes infinitesimal and therefore cannot be subdivided. Thus $P(x in Delta x) 	o 1$ when $x in Delta x$ and $P(x in Delta x) 	o 0$ otherwise.

The problem alluded to in the original post, that there are multiple $x$ values within the interval $Delta x$ (or within the volume element $Delta V$) which could have different probability amplitudes, does not exist when the limit $Delta x 	o dx$ (or $Delta V 	o dV$) is taken because the interval (or volume) element becomes infinitesimally small. Therefore, to say that $P(x in Delta x)$ is **equal to** 0 or 1 is not quite correct. It only **tends towards** 0 or 1 which then leaves room for an uncertainty principle and also means that it isn't possible to say a particle is present with absolute certainty (i.e. with unitary probability).

I hope this makes some kind of sense and I'll be glad to hear your thoughts.>
40:<It is not rounding but floor that you take (greatest integer <=).  Angle can not be >= 90 degrees.  Think of screen at infinity.  The problem also states 532 nm (not 534).>
41:<In other words, it is the second (strikes/area/time). :-)>
42:<Oh, it's true!

I supposed we were talking about the electron, so used its mass, and got the answer correct, so must be the electron mass, $m_0$.

43:<Thanks :)>
44:<A general remark: using $LaTeX$ will make your posts much more readable. :-)

The $phi$ in the last formula of your post should read $Z(z)$ I guess, at least that's what I see on the slide (edit: see you have fixed that now in your post). Now:


$T(t)(d^2 Z(z)/dz^2) + k^2phi(z,t) = T(t)(d^2 Z(z)/dz^2) + k^2Z(t)T(t) $.

So if  $T(t)(d^2 Z(z)/dz^2) + k^2Z(t)T(t)=0$ is follows (divide by $T(t)$) that

$d^2 Z(z)/dz^2 + k^2Z(t) = 0$, exactly what the slide says.>

So I would say that it is something to worry about.  The exact point is a grey area, but not *that* grey.  It would be important to get the "full angle vs half angle" question resolved, especially since one of the selections is the result for full angle and one is for half angle.>

If you like, take the following more precise definition. Take the probability, per unit volume, of finding the particle within a small volume round about the point of interest. Take the limit of that quantity as the size of this volume is shrunk towards zero. If that is zero, then we will say the probability of finding the particle at that point is zero. If the wavefunction is zero, then the probability of finding the particle at that point will be said to be zero under this definition.>
57:<That's a very good point. They have mentioned in a post somewhere that we should take the mass of an electron. And it's a bit intuitive since it was discussed a level energy difference in the last videos, but still. Maybe i am silly and i want to put a neutrino in there :)) .>
58:<If you think about it, whenever the probability wave function is *sinusoidal* (from solving Schrodinger's equation under different boundary conditions), we get positions of zero probability. I've also been trying to wrap my head around this so "un-classical" situation :)>

61:<I don't see how $c$ can't be but $1$. Since in Q4 $f(x)=psi_k(x)$ for some $k$, from the definition of expansion coefficients, we have $psi_k(x)=sum_{n} c_n psi_n(x)$. Multiplying both sides by $psi_k^*(x)$, integrating, and assuming orthogonality, we get $c_k=1$.

Note that it suffices to assume linear independence, since rearranging the expansion as $(1-c_k)psi_k(x)=sum_{n
eq k} c_n psi_n(x)$, we then need $1-c_k=0$.>
62:<So, while there's no analytic solution for $sqrt{epsilon}	an(frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon}) = sqrt{
u_0 - epsilon}$ (and the other equation), I got curious whether the *number of solutions* could be found out analytically. The answer turned out to be an easy yes.

![enter image description here][<zipRedac>]


Red curve: $sqrt{
u_0 - epsilon}$, Blue curve(s): $sqrt{epsilon}	an(frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon})$, Yellow curve(s): $-sqrt{epsilon}cot(frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon})$

The number of intersections (solutions) is the number of blue and yellow curve(s) that cut the $x$ axis in the interval $[0, 
u_0]$. 

$sqrt{epsilon}	an(frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon})$ cuts the $x$ axis whenever $frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon} = (n - 1)pi$. Since the maximum value of $epsilon$ is  $
u_0$, we get the number of solutions, $n le 1 + frac{1}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{
u_0} = leftlfloor 1 + frac{1}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{
u_0} ightfloor$. 

A similar reasoning for $-sqrt{epsilon}cot(frac{pi}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{epsilon})$, yields the number of solutions $m = leftlfloor frac{1}{<zipRedac>} + frac{1}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{
u_0} ightfloor$

So, the total number of solutions, and thus eigenstates, is $N = n + m = leftlfloor 1 + frac{1}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{
u_0} ightfloor + leftlfloor frac{1}{<zipRedac>} + frac{1}{<zipRedac>}sqrt{
u_0} ightfloor approx 1 + sqrt{
u_0}$ to the nearest integer.


For example, $
u_0 = 40$ (in the graph above), gives $N = lfloor 4.16 floor + lfloor 3.66 floor = 7$.

We can substitute $
u_0 = V_0 / E_1^{infty}$ to get $N approx 1 + sqrt{<zipRedac>mV_0}L_z/hbar pi$

Some fun this was :)

63:<But note that, from my reasoning above, *whatever* the basis set including non-normalized $psi(x)=x$ is, its expansion coefficient $c$ can't be computed according to the definition given in the quiz, because if you do, you can't "complete" $f(x)=x$ with the other functions in the basis, since they are (supposed to be) orthogonal (or at least linearly independent) with respect to $f(x)=psi(x)$. So, as I see it, if $c$ is the expansion coefficient for $psi$, it can only be $1$. So, the definition of $c$ in the quiz only applies to normalized $psi$, which is not the case.>
64:<Thank you very much for the explanation! 

As I understand, your boundary conditions to discard a left-moving wave on the right side are that it can't be physically generated, since there is no second barrier to the right. 

I still don't understand well how do the probabilities apply, in particular if the wave corresponds to the probability amplitude of a single electron and I wanted to detect it by putting a plate on the left side far from the barrier, and also at a very long distance from its source (which I suppose much farther to the left). What would be the probabilities to detect it on *each* side of the plate? I suppose it can only depend on *when* I put the plate. If it's soon, it's hard to imagine that it can't be but $p=1$, on the left side of the plate (i.e. only consider the first wave, normalized). If we let the electron pass by, and then put the plate, consider only the other two scattered waves, re-normalized.

Now, if instead of a single electron it's a wave plenty of them, I suppose that for that same plate and position, I'd had to compute the probabilities from the normalized 3-component wave equation. In principle, with probability $p_1$ of detecting electrons on the left side of the plate greater than $p_2$ on its right side, with $p_3=1-p_1-p_2$ corresponding to "lost" electrons that passed the original barrier. I'd even say that $p_1$ should be about $0.5$, since there are "as many" electrons on both sides of the plate. In summary, we should have $p_1=p_2+p_3=0.5$.

But all that reasoning seems hard to reconcile in both cases, particularly in the latter, with the computed wavefunction: it's hard to admit that if I put the plate precisely in one (of many such) point where $|psi|^2$ is 0, I'll detect no electron: where would they go? The only way out I can imagine is that when we'll consider time later on in the course, integration on time will give us sort of the probabilities as above, and that currently the wavefunctions can be only considered as in, say, $t=0$ or, more generally, $t=kT$. However, that'd be conceptually different from the infinite potential well, where I understood that the solution waves were stationary.>

66:<Unfortunately I don't have experience of the MOOCs you cite, so I can't make comparisons but beyond obvious 'objective' measures of good presentation (lack of oral 'umms and ahhs', clear articulation, no cluttered slides etc) the perceived quality of technical presentations seems primarily a subjective matter, depending on who you are (prior knowledge, educational background, first language etc.) Even Feynman's lectures, brilliant at the conceptual level, were criticised by some for lack of real substance.

I'm not sure if many participants on this MOOC want to "really learn the material" in the sense you mean but yes, more challenging problems would be a bonus in some sort of framework that avoided alienating those struggling with the basics or just casually interested.

75:<I am really enjoying the textbook for this class. My university training was mostly math; much of physics seemed to us up-and-coming math majors to be hand-waving & wishful thinking. :-) So I probably made physics harder than it needed to be. Prof. Miller's book helps with that; it has the same clear & measured commentary as his lectures, with added context. I only wish there more solutions available for the exercises in the text, so I could check my work. This class should make it much easier to dive into Shankar or Landau on QM.>
76:<I think that, *physically* speaking, you're right. Mathematically, however, you can just put any polynomial $psi(x)=P(x)$ in the time-independent equation and compute which $V(x)$ its needed for $P(x)$ to be a solution. Nonetheless, I think this quiz is just a mathematical exercise for expansion coefficients, i.e. how to compute a coefficient when $f(x)$ is going to be put in terms of a basis of orthogonal functions containing $psi(x)$.>
77:<I think if the the total Energy is less than the Potential energy you can't find the particle inside the barriers (Classical thinking) but from the quantum thinking point of view if V is much larger than E you will have very small probability of finding the particle inside the wall(barriers) (seems near the classical thinking) .. however if E is near to V the probability increase by tunneling effect (this has no analogue to classical thinking !!) ... same with the case of parabolic increasing Potential .. the most of our probability is to find the particle inside the distance where his total energy still over the potential energy (E> 0.5*K*z^2) and we where supposing that at the Energy = Potential point (classical turn out) this s the point we shouldn't find the particles after !! However there is also some tunneling happening for some distance and it was supposed that this particle don't exist at all after the classical turning point ;) ... check pages 42 and 43 of slides of particles in potential wells !!>

Since it's the electron that has the energy (there is no "bottom" in the "well", which is just a region where the electron is confined; and there isn't, or at least we haven't been taught of, energy "at a place"), one may reasonably think that it means the "lowest possible energy" (at the "bottom" of the possible energy levels for the electron). Moreover, this interpretation is in fact quite in accordance with the lecture where this energy was given a specific name ("zero-point energy"), which again seems to be quite equivalent to "energy at the bottom". Finally, the phrase, if interpreted as in the answer, is in itself unnecessary (and so its presence confusing), it had sufficed in that case to ask for the expected energy, i.e. absolute one.

I don't know, but in fact mine might have been the original interpretation in the answer, and later changed. Anyway, I suggest to clarify the wording.

Now that I know the expected :) meaning, I suppose it's fair for me to redo the calculations and put a new answer...>
81:<For instance, we have a wave function as psi(z)=sin(pi*z/6Lz)+sin(5pi*z/4Lz)/sqr(2). It satisfies the boundary function, by which I mean, psi(0)=0, psi(Lz)=0. Is this a valid wave? Will there also be an eigenstate for it?

As k1=pi/6Lz, k2=5pi/4Lz, we can calculate its energy with h^2*(k1^2+k2^2)/(2m)>
82:<Thank you very much for the clarification. I understand thus that it's a possibly standard term to refer to the potential inside the well region. However, not being used to it, I find it confusing, since after replacing the word "potential" for "energy" to refer to the potential inside ("at the bottom of") the well, now we are left with two "things" that have "energy": the electron as well as the well ;), and thus it's ambiguous: if it referred to the electron, that bottom energy might well refer to its zero-point one. Finally, since the expression implicitly assumes a situation where that potential "at the bottom" can be arbitrarily fixed, then that arbitrary value should be specified.>
83:<I understand now better (thanks!) the rationale for that established language, but still think that "relative to the *potential* at the bottom (supposing it to be 0)" would avoid some potential confusions ;).

Regarding energy non-absoluteness, that's surprising to me, since I've (apparently, at least) mostly seen energy in absolute terms, e.g. $omega=E/hbar$. I can't change $omega$ by arbitrarily choosing $V_0$, can I?>
84:<Thanks for your help :) I understand it now.>
85:<I see... So that's why the *real* thing is $|Psi(x,t)|^2$, although we need some (relative) $Psi(x,t)$ in order to be able to compute interferences, ...

Regarding $omega$, I've just verified that it actually is **relative** (and thus also $v_p=omega/k$, as you may suggest), at least for the infinite well, since when we arbitrary choose $V_0>0$, we get $omega_n=frac{	extstyle E_n}{	extstyle hbar}=$ $frac{	extstyle V_0}{	extstyle hbar}+$ $frac{	extstyle hbar}{	extstyle 2m}left(frac{	extstyle npi}{	extstyle L}ight)^2$, and then again any linear combination of $Psi_n(x,t)=sqrt{frac{	extstyle 2}{	extstyle L}}sinleft(frac{	extstyle npi x}{	extstyle L}ight)e^{	extstyle -iomega_n t}$ satisfies both the time-independent and time-dependent Schrödinger equations!

I still wonder what happens to $|Psi(x,t)|^2$ for sufficiently large $V_0<0$ such that some $omega$ and $v_p$ become zero or negative! At least for the particle in a box, I've seen that nothing changes in the superposition of two eigenstates (where what matters to the dynamics are the relative energies ;), so it's possibly the same in general.

Finally, regarding classical kinetic energy, I understand what you mean, because I can use in $frac{1}{2}mv^2$ the velocity $v$ relative to a coordinate axis moving at some $v'$.

Thanks again!>
86:<What is interesting and what the professor should have mentioned and is usually discussed in even non-relativistic QM is that both the classical & relativistic Energy Momentum dispersion relations lead to the same group velocity - namely the velocity of the particle.  Thus E=1/2mV^2 and E^2=P^2+m^2 both lead to the same dE/dP = v.  And it even works for photons E=P -> dE/dP =1.>

93:<In Video 4.1.4 around 14:15, the PD is said to be "wiggling about all over the place, and it never repeats itself."

If this was a regular class I would have popped my hand up right away to clarify, or if I was up to speed this week I would have posted on this earlier.  Sorry I'm a little behind here.  Anyway, here's my question:

Really "never"?  That would imply a continuous supply of true random information.  The PD has not yet been measured here which (as I currently understand things) is the moment when randomness is created ("the dice are rolled").  That is, there are "no hidden variables", so randomness doesn't come into play until "measurement".  But if this really never repeats itself, then randomness is being created constantly *before* measurement which is **very new to me**! :-)

Or, is "never" just a loose description meaning it takes a long time to cycle through the combinations of its cycles, so long that to our feeble brains it just *feels* like "never"?>

99:<While looking for those E&M videos on my hard drive I completely forgot I had an upper division classical mechanics course from the Norwegian University of Science and Technlogoy that I haven't done yet.

100:<Now that we've had lesson 4, I can review this experiment where I put a "double-sided" screen quite far to the left of the barrier.

I think it's clear in the case of a single electron packet moving from the far left, in a time-dependent analysis. It depends on when I put the screen. If it's so late that I (mostly) allow the electron pass when it's still moving from left to right, then the probability on the left side will be extremely low, while on the right side it'll depend on the wall height. The remaining probability "goes away" to the right of the wall.

However, I think now that we can't truly do a time-independent analysis for the case of the stationary time-independent waveform. I think again that the solution can only be analyzed from the moment that the screen is inserted. From that moment on, the waves coming from both directions cannot interfere anymore in the vicinity of the screen, and thus what previously was a low-probility point, now (integrating in time for the duration of the measurement) becomes a "normal" probability value, which I think can't be but proportionally the same (or very near) to the probability computed in the case of the electron packet. So I think that the intuition $p_1=p_2+p_3=0.5$ still essentially holds.>
101:<Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that it's usual to call "value" of a physical vector magnitude to its modulus. In this sense, I think that "need more information" is not the right answer for Q1. Even reading the question in terms of "the reasonable expectation of what's intended".

More specifically for the case of the momentum: isn't it reasonable to say that the "value" of the momentum is, let's say, nonnegative scalar $p$, so that momentum ${f p}=p{f u}$, where $f u$ is a unit vector in its direction? And that if me *measure* that $f p$ in some direction, what we get is the "*momentum in that direction*", i.e. the projection of $f p$ on that direction? In other words, I think that "need more information" might be the correct answer only if Q1 asked for "the momentum in the direction of [say] positive $z$", or asked for "the momentum" (not "the value of the momentum").

Re-reading the question I should module somehow what I've just written, since I see now that it's using the expression "expectation value". So it's asking for the "< expectation value > of the momentum", not "the expectation < value of the momentum >" (if we accept expectation=expected). But then I wonder: if the direction of movement & measurement were given, then a scalar would be an acceptable answer? In other words, wouldn't be the intended answer the modulus of the momentum (in some direction) also in that case?>

103:<What was it you wanted to measure?  ;)
I guess asking four questions at once puts people off!

In areas with more particles, the chance of finding a particle is higher, so particle density is equivalent to probability density is equal to |psi|^2.

Charged particle currents will have associated electrical currents, and a changing current will drive electromagnetic radiation.  You can look up Maxwell's equations if you're interested.  The problem being addressed here is why an electron in an eigenstate doesn't radiate, so it's the electromagnetic radiation we're interested in.

Again, the statement wasn't that there is no current, but that the current wasn't changing, and so there's no radiation.>

105:<I calculated
$ frac{d<z>}{dt}$ for a superposition state $psi(z,t)=psi_1(z)exp(frac{-E_1t}{ar h})+ psi_2(z)exp(frac{-E_2t}{ar h})$

Similarly, I calculated $frac{<p>}{m}$.

The two are equal,i.e., 

$frac{<p>}{m}=frac{d<z>}{dt}$. 

which what would be expected from classical mechanics. Is this is a general property regardless of the superposition state?  I mean if any linear combination of the eigenstates for any quantum system is formed, then the expected values will always be related in the same way their classical counterparts are related?

Another related point, for the SH oscillator, I understand that as N increases the coherent state gets more localized. But what about the frequency $omega$ shouldn't it approach $sqrt{frac{K}{m}}$?. What I see from the used relation of the coefficients of the coherent state is that the expected value increases with N. So I wonder how do we select N?. Is there a systematic way to find its value? or is it more like "picking" the suitable N which fits the results to the classical value?>
106:<Why did you think the vector product was the cross product? ;)

Do we really need two different names for the same thing?

This ambiguity has existed in the literature for over a hundred years. 

The terms "cross product" and "dot product" were introduced in the United States by Prof Gibbs sometime around 1900. The terms "vector product" and "scalar product" were introduced in England at about the same time by Oliver Heaviside, who modified ideas from Hamilton's Quaternions to construct his own version of vectors.

Officially, Sir William Rowan Hamilton introduced the word "vector" into the lexicon in the mid 1800s. Actually, I read somewhere that the term 'radial vector' was used at least once prior to Hamilton's usage of 'vector', in some other published work. However, Hamilton adopted the word and gave it the first popularly used meaning.

In Hamilton's algebra, the 'vector' was the imaginary part of a quaternion, $q = q_0 + q_1i + q_2j + q_3k$, written, $Vq = q_1i + q_2j + q_3k$, while the 'scalar' was the real part, written, $Sq = q_0$. Actually, Hamilton introduced six special *operator* letters, $S, V, K, N, T, U$, used as a prefix to the quaternion to indicate 'Scalar', 'Vector', 'Conjugate', 'Norm', 'Tensor', and 'Versor'. (The 'Tensor' is what we now think of as the 'absolute value' or 'magnitude'). The product of two vectors produced what modern engineers might think of as a strange entity, it's the sum of a scalar and a vector. So, if, $a = a_1i + a_2j + a_3k$, and, $b = b_1i + b_2j + b_3k$, then the vector product is,

$ab = Sab + Vab$

where

$Sab = -(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3)$

$Vab = (a_2b_3 - a_3b_2)i + (a_3b_1 - a_1b_3)j + (a_2b_3 - a_3b_2)k$

Some scientists objected to Hamilton's quaternions on various grounds, and eventually two main characters in the historical drama, Oliver Heaviside and Prof Gibbs, emerged with similar systems to compete with quaternions. 

Oliver Heaviside took many of Hamilton's ideas and concepts and "adapted" them for his own work. He kept some of Hamilton's notation, changed others, wrote $ab$, for the vector product that produced a scalar, dropping the, $S$, prefix, changing the minus sign '-' to a plus '+', and used $Vab$, for the vector product that produced a vector, which he then called "the scalar product" and "the vector product", instead of "scalar part of" and "vector part of" the vector product. Thus began some ambiguity and confusion, refinement, and muddling of names and terms. The term 'vector' the>

115:<Possibly, as markweiztman said above, we always have $dfrac{langle|{f p}|^2angle}{2m}=langle Eangle$, but neither $dfrac{langle|{f p}|angle^2}{2m}=langle Eangle$ (of which I'd like to see a counter-example) nor $dfrac{|langle{f p}angle|^2}{2m}=langle Eangle$, as we've just seen. 

Of course, here I'm extending the notation for expected value of a measurement to $langle o({f p})angle	riangleqsum_n |c_n|^2o({f p}_n)$,
where $|c_n|^2$ is the probability of measuring ${f p}_n$, and $o({f p}_n)$ some mathematical 
operation on ${f p}_n$. 

If we take it to be $o({f p}_n)=dfrac{|{f p}_n|^2}{2m}=langle E_nangle$, i.e. the expected value of the energy for the state resulting from momentum measurement. And considering that it should be that $sum_n|c_n|^2langle E_nangle=langle Eangle$, since the expectation value of the energy should be independent, I think, of whether it's measured directly or indirectly (via momenta). Then we would have

egin{eqnarray}dfrac{langle |{f p}|^2angle}{2m}=sumlimits_n |c_n|^2dfrac{|{f p}_n|^2}{2m}=sum_n|c_n|^2langle E_nangle=langle Eangle.end{eqnarray}

But I don't understand well the implications of $Delta ADelta Bgeqdfrac{|ar C|}{2}$ when one of them has no uncertainty, for instance, A:

134:<moonlove,

Please disregard the nasty noobie-biting above.  The straightforward answer would be "no".  But, you can still review the materials and learn from them though.  Do it!  It's great! :-)

The way it works is that you can get points if you do the "quizes" (which for *this* course are akin to homework) and "assignments" (which for this course are like tests) before the due date (actually "due moment").  After that moment, the answers may be discussed openly and the correct answers are displayed right there below the question.  So, no points can be awarded for "correct" answers then because the answers are already given.

If you start in the middle of the course, you've lost the opportunity to get the points from the first part of the course.  After about a few weeks into the course, you won't be able to get a certificate even if you score 100% on the rest of the course.  Depending on your personality, you may or may not need that certificate/grade incentive to compel you learn the material thoroughly.  Most people need that incentive, I know **I** need it.  If you're superhuman though, then maybe you don't.

But, regardless of how deeply you learn it, you *will* learn *something* good!  So, do it.  The world needs *you* to understand QM.  The more the world knows QM, the faster technology moves, and the sooner I get my flying car!  :-)>

141:<Hmm...yes. "try try again" seems to have become a recurring theme for me of late.. :P>
142:<I finished all the possible trials without giving the right answer ! and for writing two significant figures I before -in other problems- wrote more than the required figures and it wasn't giving wrong :)
I used the Equation written by the Professor in the slides but not helping also !>
143:<Mark
I now understand the reason for your tolerance of poor pedagogy--you went to Caltech.  As a MIT graduate I am accustomed to a higher standard:)>
144:<@papastauf Are you a lawyer with MIT background ? Because you mention [**here**][1] that **"**@mark Perhaps I am lawyering the question because that is my profession, and perhaps also because I have experienced other courses where the questions laid out mathematical traps for the unwary**"** .Just curious, because i would like to know how those two work together. Fermat was also a lawyer :)) .

145:<>...Stay focused on the goal: to learn quantum mechanics.

Definitely! :)>
146:<Thank you.
If there is a way to have the Quizzes as pdf files with relevant worked out solutions, then one could continue working through them once the course site has been closed.

By the way, I noticed your book on Amazon.co.uk and can't wait for it to reach my post box :) Many thanks for your clear, well explained lectures and such a well laid out on-line course.>
147:<Yep, that's an idea. Cheers! :)>
148:<I think the correct answers are twice what is shown in the answers.  For example with m=1 $sin(mphi)$ will have zeros at $phi=0$ and $phi=pi$, thus there are two zeros for m = 1 at a fixed radius and polar angle.  Another way to think about it is there are m nodal lines through the poles and each nodal line through the poles has two zeros at fixed r,$	heta$.>
149:<We had it all - metres, feet, inches, furlongs, rods, perches, chains - and Newton's Laws in Poundals :)>
150:<:))>
151:<Mark:

 How old are you?  You cannot be older than me.  What is the probability amplitude and uncertainty principle associated with our relative ages? :)>
152:<Make sure your eigenvalues are dimensionally consistent with what the problem asks for :)>
153:<Okay, I noticed that depending on what accuracy I take my constants in, I get differences in the answers 3rd significant figure.
To clarify, if I would plug in
$m_{electron}=9.11cdot 10^{-31}kg$,
$h_{bar}=1.05cdot 10^{-34}Jcdot s$, $eV=1.6cdot 10^{-19}J$ and calculate the eigenvalues from the matrix given in the previous exercise, I'ld get a (correct) answer in the format xx.x (if I convert it to meV)?

I'm asking so specifically because I'm up to my last submission and every time I vary my constants even a little I get a slightly different answer. :)>
154:<:)>
155:<Heh, did it at last with Mathcad, keeping everything accurate to the 17th decimal place and got an answer that differed by 1 unit in the last significant digit (compared to what I had already entered and got marked as incorrect). Luckily, that answer was correct. The tolerance really IS tight. :)>
156:<Use euler's identity.
PS: How did you made it so far? :))))>
157:<Use formula given in slides.
I know its pretty complicated but we have to fight hard.:p
bdw will u plz explain littlebit about euler's identity?>
158:<It's not even necessary to memorize that mysterious equation.  This one can be "derived on the fly" in a moment.  You just have to know that r*exp(i*theta), or the result of *any* equation, is a complex number, a point on the complex plane.  Complex numbers are both 1) "two-dimensional" numbers and 2) a complete general definition of the *idea* of a "number".  r*exp(i*theta) in the complex plane compares to the polar form of plotting a point (a 2D number) on the XY plane.  At the same time, the a+b*i form in the complex plane compares to the "rectangular" form of plotting a point on the XY plane.

Often (as it is here) r is 1.0, so "exp(i*theta)" is a point in the complex plane on a unit circle.  It's at an angle "theta" counterclockwise from the real axis just like polar coordinates.  From that,the "X" component (a) must be cos(theta) and the "Y" component (b) must be sin(theta).  To get the "a+b*i" form, the "vertical" component of that two-dimensional number (complex number) plane is written as multiplied by "i".  So it falls out that the result is cos(theta) + i*sin(theta)

That's one less weirdo identity the human race needs to remember!  :-)>
159:<Oh, yes - now I see the break in the line. I kept wondering why it was necessary to multiply the factorial by 1 - duh! :-) Thanks.>
160:<Indeed - "The first step in a person's salvation is knowledge of their sin." - Seneca :)>
161:<... which is a violation of copyright :)>
162:<I for one love this QM course. A few aspects make this experience particularly satisfying. <1> The quizzes and assignments make me go back to re-discover what my eyes had merely glazed over in a hurry; <2> Picking out salient features of the QM results of a model system (e.g. how many nodal circles are allow and how they are divided up between those cutting through the poles and those that are parallel to the equator); <3> Sufficient justification for the mathematical steps (e.g. power series expansion for exponentiating iHt/h_bar in lesson#11, (4) neat and simple observations (e.g. using matrix approximation of derivative operator d/dx to show it is not hermitian (and therefore one sees why i.d/dx is hermitian; and e.g. the Schrodinger equation, by dint of having d/dt, fully determines future and past wave function from the present wave function, unlike ordinary wave equations of 2nd order); (5) numerical examples in the lectures, quizzes and assignments are well chosen to give concrete feel of the scale at which phenomena become non-negligible and what can be omitted in a 1st order approximation. 

Last but not least, I like it that the quizzes and assignments have strict deadlines. They made me regularly digest a good chunk of QM each week despite competing priorities. I missed one of the assignments because I was late, and quickly learned to each assignment done within the week. I have collected a number of QM books over the years but work always had priority over reading them. This QM course is what got me over the hurdle. BIG THANK YOU to Prof and the staff!  :-)  PLEASE DO THE SEQUEL. I yearn to get to spin, identical particles, band theory, quantization of fields, ...>
163:<1989 here!... its more approximate :P>
164:<"Seems right to me" - quoting Prof. Miller here from a previous thread on the same topic :P

The checker apparently is much harsher. Just check your significant figures (don't round in the intermediate steps).>
165:<A course about $mathrm{LaTeX}$ would be insane in a MOOC :D>
166:<Thanks Mark. I thought that physics being an experimental science meant that the laws of physics are obtained from experiment;) But I guess I get your point: you use perturbation theory when the perturbation feels small and you consider an approximation good when successive terms seem to get smaller, if I understand you correctly. 

But still, isn't there a way to predict beforehand whether it will work, so as to only perform experiments for which there is some hope of success rather than always just start out computing terms and giving up when it looks hopeless. 

For example, if instead of an infinite well with a field we would have a finite well with a field, maybe an experienced perturbation theorist would know right away that this can or cannot be approached feasibly with perturbation theory, or maybe only if the field strength is smaller or much smaller than the well depth. 

Your remark about the divergence surprises me. Can that easily happen in the context treated in this course, or is that more something that happens in more advanced quantum theory or with exceptionally bad-behaved Hamiltonians? 

Thanks>
167:<Here are some small observations i've made of how we can calculate the $hat H_{ij}$ elements of a finite matrix for a field **f = 1** , based on $ i , j $ indexes only:                                         1) The matrix is symmetric (we already know that)  $implies hat H_{ij} = hat H_{ji}  $ 2) The elements of the diagonal are the unperturbed energy eigenstates (nothing new), or $hat H_{ii} = i*i   $  .3) The elements above and below the diagonal $hat H_{ij} = hat H_{ji}$, where $j=i+1$ are $hat H_{ij} = -dfrac {i*j*8}{(i+j)^2*pi^2} $ .This is only a empiric observation.
**Check:** $hat H_{23} = -48/(2<zipRedac>*pi^2) $ for $f=1$.This means that for  a field of $f = 3$ like in the lecture, $hat H_{23} = -3*48/(2<zipRedac>*pi^2) = 0.<zipRedac>8361 $ .
CORRECTION 1 : ".The rest of the elements are $0$" is FALSE .As Chema and Ibrahim  suggested, for odd index terms, like $j=i+3, j=i+<zipRedac>$ etc,$hat H_{ij} = -dfrac {i*j*8}{(i-j)^2*(i+j)^2*pi^2} $ .Anybody can feel free to add it's "algorithm" for the rest of the elements.
CORRECTION 2:Professor Miller has pointed out that there is an analitic formula for calculating the integral for $hat H_{ij}$ in [*the mathematics reference*][1], number (40).With a small change of variable, we get the same thing.

168:<Thank you indeed Mark for your help during this course (and also during the Coursera one). I'll probably be seeing you in yet another QM course some day!

I'll use this opportunity to also thank David Miller for a wonderful experience. I hope you consider doing more courses. You have a very sympathetic style that makes learning very relaxing (I'm sure the nice background and mellow music/colors you use during your lectures also helps :) ).>
169:<Aha OK I got it, it's related to the Previous question and I got the right answers ;)
but as a feedback you should stress on this point that such question is related to the previous one, hope you care about this point.. Thanks in advance :)>
170:<Just put l=0, the new function of the Potential Vnew will be the same as the old one  and the term which include 1/r^2 will be thrown away and it will be somehow same like the  the potential well with infinite barriers solution.. it's very easy ;)>
171:<Oh, That's Exactly what I have been looking for :D>
172:<Actually other terms is not all zero :)
I tried by integral and that's what I get :
*the diagonal elements are i*i
*the element where i+j= even is all zero (because of symmetry)
*the elements over the diagonal (j=i+1) and (i=j+1) are following the empirical result you opposed ;)
*the elements with (i=j+3) or (j=i+3) (Away off the diagonal) also exist and following the same empirical relation but by multiplying by 1/9 = 3^-2 
*the elements with (i=j+5) or (j=i+5) (Far away off the diagonal) also exist and following the same empirical relation but by multiplying by 1/25 = 5^-2 
*the elements with (i=j+7) or (j=i+7) (Very far away off the diagonal) also exist and following the same empirical relation but by multiplying by 1/49 = 7^-2
*the elements with (i=j+9) or (j=i+9) (Very very far away off the diagonal) also exist and following the same empirical relation but by multiplying by 1/81 = 9^-2
.

:)
You can try it my friend :)>
173:<The Equation of the radial part x(r) will be very likely to the free particle in zero potential with potential barriers tends to inf at ro 
x(r) = A*exp(ikr) + B*exp(-ikr)
and solve for the x(0)=0 and x(ro)=0 to get the relation between A and B and hence the Eigen Energies for l=0 and different quantum number n and the associated Eigen functions x(r) for the different n.
to get R(r) = x(r)/r ... and go on :)>
174:<Dear Professor Miller,
I think when (i+j = even number) the element should be Zero due to the symmetry of the Integral accompanied by the Relative Field "F" (Integral of Even fn* Even fn * Odd fn = zero OR Integral of Odd fn * Odd fn * Odd fn = zero) because in both cases we will be finally integrating an odd function around the point of reflection :)>
175:<I've got $E_1^inf = 53.71<zipRedac>5$ , $f = 1.<zipRedac>61556$ and the eigenvalue $eta_1 = 0.<zipRedac>631$ .This means that $E_1 = eta_1*E_1^inf = 51.736$.This could be solved by approximation using the formula from lesson 23 page 47 $eta_1= epsilon_1-0.010<zipRedac>*f^2$, which results in $eta_1 = 0.<zipRedac>6257 implies E_1 = 51.70<zipRedac>0$.PS: The matrix elements were calculated for f=3, so to find the non diagonal ones we just had to multiply  by $1.<zipRedac>6155/3$ like in the quiz <zipRedac>.2.2 Q6. To be honest the hard ones that worth some threads were Q1 and Q10. But since in the second attempt everyone got full score :) , there were none.>
176:<Since the music isn't bossa nova, my guess is that is [**Standford Campus**][1] .

177:<Coz it is a bigger pain to lose by 1% rather than 5 or 10%. BTW, I am higher than 90 but still desperate to get the answer right for the remaining 2-3 questions... I know this from behavioral economics :P>
178:<@markweitzmann - not everyone is of the same age as yours. :P Just kidding here...
The question is not about certificate vs. knowledge. It's about missing something that is in one's reach.

@Alex_Alexandrescu - you are right. I follow that field more than just taking a course (read many such books)>
179:<Remember, the separation is (2 * deltaE), not (deltaE)... :P>
180:<Thank You Professor :)>
181:<THANK YOU PROF. MILLER & CO. for all of your hard work and patience in bringing these treasures to us!  I hope hope hope there will be a follow-up! :D>
182:<its simple, any of us can report their own score here :)>
183:<I would be happy even if someone else answers it :)>
184:<Thanks a lot for introducing such an incredibly comprehensible course on QM. I have learned many things that as an independent learner i was unable to understand. It's like your course has added a new dimension of lucidity and QM is no longer an unbeatable adversary but an intriguing field that offers new insight to the ways of the universe. I can never thank you enough. Your teaching method is, as a fellow participant in this course put it "empathetic" toward a student's state of mind. One doesn't feel intimidated by the concepts, rather, there is an increasing sense of awe followed by clear understanding. I am still not in the least as good as i want to be in this subject but your course has provided a solid base for me and i fiercely intend to keep learning and improving myself.
I have ordered your book as well, hoping to solve more problems as a test of the concepts that i have grasped.
Thanks to every member of the team, the technical support staff. Your response was immediate and helpful.
Thank you to all the participants of the course, your queries and responses were most helpful.
And last but not the least, a big congratulations to myself for i managed to stick to the course despite having come very close to missing a few assignment deadlines! :P>
185:<Lol, sorry about that. While i was pressing the submit button i realized that was not addressed to me. ( I just hoped that you will not read, because it's silly. :) )>
186:<yes, i mean achieve, i apologize for my grammatical mistake, maybe you have  similar problems in your  second language :)
any way, this one and some similar  previous posts,  lead me to  think, with all the respect, that you are a bit abrupt, even rude.

Correct answer in A9-Q4 ends in 8, maybe all  the 3 significant figures are wrong.

Thanks anyway for your interest :)>
187:<Congratulations that you pulled this one off.In a while there you were under the weather :) if i am not mistaken . If i am guessing correct, i will be seeing you the next session, because the score i've got i don't think i have earned it, thanks to a few lucky mistakes.>
188:<Looking forward to the next session, too. Many thanks, Mr. Miller. I cannot be more grateful :-)>
189:<To bad we cannot enjoy ourselves with a couple of jars and inevitably plunge into one of those philosophical discussions the professor talked about in the final lecture :)).>
190:<Yes Alex, i was a little under the weather thanks to a nasty flu that put me to bed for 3 whole weeks! But i managed to get well above 90% and that should make me happy but all it does is make me feel like i have not earned it really (though i didn't rely on guesswork, but like you i feel my score doesn't validate how much i have learned in the past 9 weeks). I could have put in a lot more effort. Not at all satisfied with my work.
Yes, i think i am probably gonna see you in the next session as well :) and thanks for helping me in assignment 8! This is a great platform for discussion and sharing knowledge.>
191:<LOL.... The course opened up a Pandora's Box of questions. Can't blame anyone ... :P>
