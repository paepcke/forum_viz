0:<Hi,

you course looks really interesting, however the course info area does not give a syllabus, length of course, or any assessment information? It would be great to have a clearer breakdown of the topics offered please. Also will there be any video lectures, self directed study tasks, or formative assessments?

I get the feeling that this is being run more like a cMOOC as opposed to an xMOOC? Would that be a correct assumption? Thanks. :-)>
