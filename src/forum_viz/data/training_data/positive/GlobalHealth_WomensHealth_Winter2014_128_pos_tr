0:<To add on your culture and religious point - (not sure if it's relevant but here goes~) When a Chinese man and Chinese women get married, their child will bear the Man's surname rather than both. For the western countries, some people drop their surname to match with the husband as well. 
My friend who was raised by her mother only, had her father's surname. I questioned why people follow this? Culture? It feels right? Feel free to comment on this.

Another point (on culture) is this country (for the life of me, i forgot the tribe or country's name!) supported the culture of men kidnapping a female to make them their wife. Kidnap, not forced marriage! 

Another point (on religious view) is this - in some religion, the men is allowed to marry a X number of females, and female is only expected to serve one husband. Outrageous for some people. Obedients Wives Club supported the idea to shape women to what their religion told them to be for optimal pleasure for the husband. 

I am just adding points. :) Great to see such comments! Feel free to correct me - i am learning as much as you do too~>
1:<Halo, I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> from Indonesia. I'm a social student in (secondary) high school. Okay, I'm taking this course to improve my knowledge about human rights.

Nice to know you, guys:)>
2:<Hey,Thalita. I'm Ting from Thailand. Nice to see a fellow high school student taking this course too. It's great meeting you! :)>
3:<Hi! I'm Jenny from New York City. I graduated with a degree in Telecommunications last May and have spent the last few months working for an advertising agency in the city. I've always loved learning more about human rights under every segment of discrimination (gender, sexuality, income, etc.) I would love to get to know you all! We can set up our own study group :)>
4:<I agree with you. There is a lot of material we can each begin to practically apply. :)>
5:<I couldn't remember what it was called when it is preferred to have boys...just reread --The son preference. Just incase you all were wondering :)>
6:<It was just a shame it ended so abruptly! I would've liked it to go into more detail about the specific conventions and conferences but appreciate it's a lot to get into a video! (I'm listening on 2x speed which is great but does leave me thinking they're not long at all ;D) The idea of sovereignty is so interesting and I was particularly struck by the three ways or means by which countries don't deliver on treaties they sign on to - whether due to cash / resources, due to non-intention in the first place, or using the excuse of needing time to "roll out" rights!>
7:<I'm left thinking about the implications of a shift from a "development" lens to "human rights" lens. Is this shift largely academic/intellectual, or logistical? In a practical sense, are there any goals emphasized by a development frame that take a back-seat from the HR POV? Does the shift prioritize any goals that have not been seen as a priority under the development lens?

Venn diagram, please! :)>
8:<Hey everyone! :)

I'm so excited to learn with you guys about women's health in the context of human rights and social justice.

I'm <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>, an international student from the Philippines, studying in Los Angeles. I'm majoring in Anthropology, and definitely looking forward to share my first-hand experience as a girl who grew up in a third-world country and living in the slums.

I'm very interested in doing some grassroots project that our groups can work on. :D>
9:<Hi everybody! I´m glad to be here and of course I agree with code. ;)>
10:<Hi Everyone, 

I am looking forward to participating in this course and meeting new, smart, creative people. My name is Tijana. I finished my bachelor's degree in the area of management. However, I continued to pursue my passion in peace and conflict studies at the United Nations University in Tokyo. My research focused on the issue of the gender inequality. Research incorporated the language analysis of the Security Council Resolution 1325 and Millennium Development Goals. Further, I worked with the UN-Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on the issues of gender, as part of the Gender Advisory Team. 

Looking forward meeting you all :)!
Warm regards, 
Tijana>
11:<The focus on the issue of mental health is definitely an area which needs and deserves more attention, hence more resources and research. Too many times when dealing with reckonings and other assessments, we tend to look at numbers and forget that behind those figures there is immense human suffering. It's about lifetime scars (both physical -see FGM or acid throwing- and psychological- see denial of education) which through sharing and counselling may find some relief and which indeed see women from many countries finding similarities in their life paths. Engagement and rising awareness should therefore be encouraged both nationally and trans-nationally. 

I also, as many others, did not find surprising the fact that many women condone violence and see wife battering as acceptable. This is a clear example of the way enculturation shapes the way not only men, but women also conceive marriage as a type of "power relationship". As a result of heavily rooted patriarchal norms combined with hardly questioned gender roles, girls grow up into women with low self esteem  led to believe that if they "misbehave" or do not accomplish their alleged "duties" in a satisfactory manner, they deserve to be beaten by their husband. It is a deeply mortifying and an extremely serious aspect to look into. 

With regards to the PRB Data Sheet in detail, I found quite interesting to see that the Philippines, which ranked 5th in the World Gender Gap Report 2013 issued by the World Economic Forum, seems to have a lower percentage of seats held by women in parliament in comparison to some other Asian countries. Nevertheless, the overview provided is important especially to understand how in some countries improvements are essential and required. 

All in all, it was a very interesting and comprehensive introduction!! Looking forward to all the rest! :-)>
12:<My name is Sarah, I am from Nigeria but I work as a full-time volunteer in Germany. I studied counseling because I constantly come across many victims of sexual violence and needed tools to equip myself with in order to help them. I am also a big justice advocate and combating human trafficking is a main goal of mine.
I am really glad to be part of the group taking this course, I look forward to connecting with the other participants and the facilitator :)>
13:<hi all. i'm Emma, i am from indonesia but currenly living in Goa, India. i feel so grateful to join this course because since i was studying at the university, women's issues is the most important part for me and thats why for my thesis, i put empowerment of women as my subject.
I agree, that women's health is so much more than a medical issue, it is a cultural , political and economic and above all an issue of social justice, because i saw itself, as i am from indonesia and i am from batak karo tribe, in our culture, there is still lot of gaps that occur between women and men and its still going on till now and in my village, there are still many women who do not get a proper education, because we karonese (my tribe), most of them still think that education is only for men, women, just taking care of household. and it also happen for me, i graduated from political science and i want to continue to get my master, many people and my family saying that there is no point in continuing education to a higher level,because at the end, a women's place is in the kitchen, and it is certainly quite contrary to the introduction ' educating girls isnt only a good economic policy, it is also the fair thing to do ; it is just'
and many other gaps that occur, particularly in Indonesia.
so i am hoping by learning from this course, like anne said, we can try to achieve positive social change. and i also hope we can share our experience.

Run the world, girls! :)>
14:<Hi There!

Im in Barbados, and I think we may share some similar experiences :-)

Lovely to meet you,

17:<Nice to meet you Adriana! :D Hope we get an opportunity to discuss the material!>
18:<Very proud that my island has signed and ratified CEDAW. We have a history of a strong women's movement in Jamaica, so they had no choice :) 

The one reservation noted was that " The Government of Jamaica declares that it does not consider itself bound by the provisions of article 29, paragraph 1, of the Convention." This provision states that:  "Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the present Convention which is not settled by negotiation shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If within six months from the date of the request for arbitration the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice by request in conformity with the Statute of the Court." I'm not sure what is the problem with this provision, but will follow up to find out why.>
19:<Hello and welcome! 

I just wanted to say that I totally agree :) Nice to meet you! 

Marta (Spain)>
20:<Hello :)

In my opinion, emotional violence can frequently be even more harmful than physical violence. 

Nice to meet you!

Marta (Spain)>
21:<Hello! :)

I totally agree! It is a lucid way of addressing such a difficult topic.

Greetings from Spain!

Marta>
22:<iHello! :) 

My name is Marta. I am really happy to join this course!! I'm an undergraduate student, currently doing research on euro-centrism and the status of women through cinema. As a person, I'm deeply moved by this topic that we're focusing on in this course: International Women's Health and Human Rights. 

I've read the contents & foreword and the prologue and I have taken a look at the data sheet. Then I have gone through many of the posts that other peers have written and I want to say how amazed I feel about the many people that have joined this course! What a great opportunity to get to meet new people who share our same concerns and outrage and support and encourage each other. 

There's not much left for me to say that other peers haven't said yet, and there's too much to discuss so I don't want to be repetitive. I will just remark a couple of thoughts after these first readings.

 - First, I feel lucky and happy to have found just a good source of
   information and inspirations as this course, its lecturer and her
   book are. I will definitely read **the book** as I find it brilliant,
   beautiful and special. 
   
 - Second, while most data were not completely new for me they are still
   as shocking and astonishing. Focusing on women as this course aims, I
   wish that **women's suffering** was **never indifferent to us**.
   
 - What was actually new for me is to realize how little research has   
   been done on this topic. SO astonishing!
 
 - After following 57th session of the **CSW** last March, I concluded that 
   one of the main problems in addressing women's issues, even by those 
   who work hard for it is probably that almost always the most   
   important **voices**, those of the "ordinary" women who really struggle  
   and suffer real problems, **are lost** when escalating problems, so **they 
   don't reach decision makers**. **Real priorities** are also forgotten.   
   Something must be done to **redirect efforts towards what is really   
   important. What do you believe should be done to address this?**

 - Also, it is really important to remember that **it is very easy to talk**
   and give advice from the outside. Many women suffering from violence don't
   denounce even when they are "protected" by law because of **fear**. In my
   opinion, understanding this would help people who work to help   
   victims of abuse being more effective.

Finally, I would like to express how much I look forward to interact with my >
23:<Hello Talitha and everyone! :D

Nice to meet you all! I am Marta, from Spain, I'm an undergraduate student.

I want to make this course the most interactive possible. After completing the introduction, I wrote a post sharing my first impressions and asking anyone interested to share their ideas on some more specific points. Please if you are interested share you opinions with me by commenting my post "My first impressions & Greetings from Spain :-)".

Marta>
24:<Hello from Canada- I look forward to spending time with you all in our virtual classroom:)>
25:<...my passion for the injustice in the world is welcomed and not considered a "Debbie Downer" story. I'm traveling the path of a student homebirth midwife in the United States. My approach to child birth is not medical but more shamanistic, primitive, and mother led. Until reading the charts on the last 5 pages I believed that birth is much safer with less medical management and intervention. However the statistics appear to poke some holes in that theory. 

 Can't say enough how glad I am to be included in this learning opportunity. While reading the assigned pages last night I had moment of inspiration for another project that I am working on. Was a lovely surprise.

This specific paragraph in the reading really appealed to me: 

Talmud: Do not be daunted by the enormity of the worlds grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now. Walk humbly, now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it. The way we do our work is key.

Looking forward to more :)>
26:<Hi girls, 

I am Jessica Hernandez from Fullerton, California, USA. It's so great to be interacting with individuals who are interested in learning about the  issues concerning women world wide ;) Nice to meet you all as well !>
27:<keep speaking up!!!! we are here in many ways  :)    you have support and powerful words the world needs to listen to!>
28:<Hi everyone, greetings from Serbia,looking forward to this course. I am a feminist active in Women in Black Network and a scholar interested in the impact of tradition and religion on women. Nice to meet you all. :)>
29:<Hira here from the UK I can't wait to start this course :D>
30:<nice to meet you too :)>
31:<It's so great to see so many nationalities united for this course! I joined the course because my knowledge on this topic has been trivial and everyday I am reminded of how "lucky" I am to have the privilege of an education, of job opportunities and even free will! The Fact sheet stunned me because, if you look at it, more women than men believe that they should be beaten after an argument with their husband. women! why? I think part of it goes back to upbringing, to the values instilled in us as children. As a child, if your mother told you that your husband was God and that it was your duty to make him happy, wouldn't that be what you grow up and try to do? If around you or in your community, you saw women around you being beaten for arguing with their husbands, wouldn't that be what you consider to be "normal" or even expected? Luckily, there is always hope. Our minds are hard-wired for change so they can be "re-programmed". Women in this day and age no matter their country of birth, economic status or age, should feel entitled to an education, to being respected, to pursuing their dreams. It's not idealism, it's activism, and that's what I'm here to learn to do :)>
32:<Hi!  My name is Dänya and like others here, I am so passionate about women's rights.  One day I hope to be apart of some sort of amazing volunteer work overseas encompassing my passion.  My degree is in social work and I am so happy about this opportunity to connect with like minded individuals via this great class! :)>
33:<As a fellow midwife - I would love to chat with you more  about maternal/child health care. I'll keep an eye out for you in the coming weeks :)>
34:<¡Hola Beatriz! 

Thank you for you answer ;) I'm very pleased to meet you! 

When did you sign up? Have you already gone through the first lesson? I will start my readings right now :) Also, are you may be taking the course with any friends or do you personally know any person taking this course? I hope we'll stay on touch!

Greetings,

Marta>
35:< It only shows me your discussion threads and username. Since I trust that I won't be spammed by anyone in the discussion thread, I will provide my e-mail: <emailRedac> I will be busy for the holiday weekend so it may take a while for me to respond. However, after next week, my schedule should return to normal. Then we can possibly discuss meetings or arrangements to talk over our experiences in Korea and the course materials :).>
36:<What emerges from this very interesting talk is the mixture of political strategy and economic interests behind governments'decisions to sign, and especially ratify and implement international human rights covenants in their countries. 

Also, it is really enlightening the explanation of how the approach behind the different UN treaties mentioned evolves in time and how CEDAW is a result of a process and indeed challenged assumptions which until that time had been either ignored or entirely under estimated, given the unquestioned nature of certain deeply rooted and widely accepted paradigms. 

Insightful analysis of the CRC ,too. All in all, great 37 minutes :)>
37:<Hi everyone, I also agree with the code. :)>
38:<Greetings from Bucharest, Romania :) I agree with the code and i look forward for fruitful discussions!>
39:<Repuplic of Korea has signed the treaty in 1983 and ratified in 1984 with the reservation of article 9, sup-paragraphs c, d, f, g of paragraph 1 of article 16. It withdrew most of the reservations in 1991 and in 1999 thanks to modifications in relevant international and domestic laws except article 9, which conflicts with domestic laws regarding children following their fathers' family name and married women being registered in their husbands' families. But I think there has been some progress in that because I hear that now people can choose between their father's and mother's family names. During my research I could see that the committee created by the CEDAW is very active, and the policy of having NGOs to send in shadow reports is effective - I could see a lot of women NGOs reports on the assessment by the CEDAW committee and their shadow reports. The main organization that works for gender equality in Korea, however, I think, is not CEDAW but another ministry under the president that concerns gender issues and family issues, although the department is not the most popular organization in Korea. :)>
40:<Hi Lilyana, I am from Italy as well :) I would like to add to your list obstetric violence.>
41:<Like Michelle and every other participant here I am sure, I feel so grateful for the opportunity to learn more about international women's health and human rights from outstanding Stanford professors and also from my classmates! 

I am a health and fitness consultant with a background in Middle East Studies also. My work involves creating  projects for girls and women  that use the practice of improved diet and exercise behaviors towards fighting weight-related disease while at the same time empowering participants. 

B/c I have partnered with the UN (& hope to again!), and continue to w/NGOs and women's organizations here in the DC area and in MENA I am finding the course extremely useful. Also, I am learning about plenty of new topics along the way :)

So far, so great!>
42:<Hi all. My name is Mai - I am a college student in the US; however, my father's from Bangladesh so I've seen some of what has been described in the prologue to women and children in Bangladesh. Whenever I visit there, I get the urge to do ***something***, but I always end up leaving the country with "*what can i do?*". 
It's always important to understand one's culture and to work from there. I don't think we can possibly make changes or promote something that one is unfamiliar or comfortable with. Advocating - especially for AIDS/HIV - is important but we have to do so in a way that is meaningful and effective so that those who are advocated can pass on the information to other women and children, and I think that's the hard concept. Not every women is like Janet - certainly not me (!). Many are aware of these issues but they don't know where to start. 'Guidance' may be the key...
I'm really excited for this course and I hope to get a lot from it :)>
43:<Great idea :) I'd love to have a summary page for each week!>
44:<Hi fiends!

I'm Alba, a nurse interested in women health inequalities. I'm glad to be here ;)

I've already read that: "The dangers start before birth. Sex-selective abortion is widespread, as parents decide for various reasons that they cannot bring another girl into the world" I have thougth about Nancy Krieger, from the harvard University. She gave us the "embodiment" concept. That means that our health is the result of the social, politic and economic context, even before getting born.
What do you think about?

Thanks>
45:<Well said!! :-) Hola from Spain!***>
46:<I feel pretty much the same way, although I think that the reservations of the US have less to do with our struggle to come to terms with the fact that a woman has a right to do what she wishes with her body and more because we, as a country, don't see ourselves as part of the world that we most definitely live in. It's some of that residual and daily xenophobia that's just engrained in our society that I find particularly taxing.

So, not unexpected, but a disappointment nonetheless. 

(figured I'd add to someones post rather than make a brand new one. Hope you don't mind =D)>
47:<I absolutely agree. I responded above but I think you said it more eloquently. :) When you talk about "human rights," (speaking as an American) there are very few people I know who would object - both to the idea and to the pressing need for activism and legal change. But I know so many people who object to the idea of "women's rights," as if it were something separate. Framing it this way, I think, will be a helpful way to get those people to understand the importance of the message.>
48:<it is a sad reality that rape is a method of peace and war.
I have been focusing on crimes against honour for many years as izzat is widespread.
i am eager to understand the complexities of this issue:)>
49:<Thank you for your comment, I haven't heard it called that. It makes sense thoughy :)>
50:<It just confirms what I included in one of my previous posts, related to how the Cold War and specially the communism affected the prioritization of CP Rights over the SEC Rights. It was as well a discovery for me the conceptualization of Right to Health under Economic Rights, I would have always said that it was a Social Right... 
Thanks! :)>
51:<I think it works now :-)>
52:<Hello! I would also love to form a group and I also live in Spain! Shall we try? :-)

Kind regards,

53:<I'd love to hear any other reflections on the following points (or on other points :) )

Spain

Signature: 17 Jul. 1980	ratification: 5 Jan. 1984

Regarding the Declarations, Reservations and Objections made by Spain:

	It took around 3 years and a half for Spain to ratify the CEDAW since its signature.

	Declaration: 

The ratification of the Convention by Spain shall not affect the constitutional provisions concerning **succession to the Spanish crown**.

	Spain has **objected** to reservations made by Saudi Arabia -upon ratification- in 2001, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea upon accession- in 2001, the Syrian Arab Republic upon accession- in 2003, and the United Arab Emirates upon accession- in 2005.

**Other countries**, such as Finland, Netherlands, Norway or Sweden, have objected to reservations from many more countries than Spain has. 

On the other hand, Canada, for example, has only objected to one countrys reservations, being this country the Republic of Maldives.

The only countries that have made objections to other countries reservations to the CEDAW are Austria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

	 The Government of the Kingdom of Spain considers that **the general reference to Islamic law**, (by Saudi Arabia)**without specifying its content**, creates doubts among the other States parties about the extent to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia commits itself to fulfill its obligations under the Convention. Spain in its objection to reservations made by Saudi Arabia upon ratification considers Saudi Arabia general reference to Islamic law as **ill-defined**. The case is similar regarding Spains objection to the Syrian Arab Republics reservations upon accession regarding Islamic Shariah, without specifying its content. 

	Furthermore, the reservation (made by Saudi Arabia) to article 9, paragraph 2, aims at excluding one of the **obligations concerning non-discrimination**, which is the ultimate goal of the Convention.

	On its objection Spain considers Koreas reservations upon accession being incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention, since it considers that they aim to **exent Korea from the commitment of the general requirement to take measures, including legislation, to eliminate all forms of discrimination ag>
54:<same here, but thanks SamBea for the suggestion :)>
55:<Thank you, SamBea! =)>
56:<It took me SO LONG to read through all of them, half because I'm not used to legalese, & half because there are so many reservations in the first place :/

Surely if a country can(disappointingly) put forward so many reservations, it can basically only take on the parts of CEDAW that are either already in place, easy to put in place or simply not going to damage their current discriminatory status quo?  

The UN page says that "the Convention permits ratification subject to reservations, provided that the reservations are not incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention."  Then it says that a State can enter reservations if they clash with national law, tradition, religion or culture, where surely quite a lot of traditions, religions & cultures are inherently discriminatory to women?  I found a lot of 'the United Kingdom reserves the right to apply UK legislation to...' parts, so they're saying for THIS bit we want to carry on with what we're doing regardless?

Also, could someone clarify the difference between reservations at time of joining or ratifying the convention, compared to a page on the UN site that looks like it has more recent reservations that I couldn't find on the other page?  (ie- "In case of contradiction between any term of the Convention and the norms of Islamic Law, the Kingdom is not under obligation to observe the contradictory terms of the Convention", dated as 6 September 2001.)

Sorry if some of these questions are a little silly! :)>
57:<Hey, Susana! Nice to meet you and what a great idea!I administer 3 groups already, but I would gladly join if you would like to take the lead! I am also on FB, you can add me if you wish so :)>

67:<Hello. Nice to meet you Catherine. Yes, there are studies about that issue. Today,

Good Morning too! It's 10am here in Spain and since I had some free time I'd allowed myself to poor myself a cup of soya milk while watching your last video :)

I'd like to thank you for your positivity and good intentions. I am really interested in your course on Love at Stanford University <3

Could you please tell me whether there is a deadline for completing this course?

Although it is not the reason why I'm taking this course, I'd like to pursue the Statement of Accomplishment. Is there a time limit to complete the course in order to get it?

Will we be able to access the course's dashboard and course's material once it's finished?

Thank you for your attention. Beautiful tea cup by the way!

Kind regards,

Marta>
71:<Hi Anny,

First I would like to provide my sincere gratitude to you and whole team putting so much efforts to design this online course. As we are moving forwards in this course I think I am deeply sinking with the readings. All the materials, readings, videos and reflections are so informative and provoking the insight. Being working in social sector we used to be surrounded by facts and data sometime; some questions just keep me pondering and I feel this course is providing excellent forum to discuss more and more.....

As I was reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,in an article I read about the rights about "Life, Liberty and Security of a person"; and it's guaranteed to each and every person. As a women, as a human being it sounds so great to me but while seeing the real situation of women in society I simply want to ask a question who provides this so called GUARANTEE? 

Govt. do not want to take accountability so as the society and any individual. When people talk about security of women in outside the world, I want to ask them do they think women are safe inside the home? Ask a women who's a another victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment by her family or neighbor and at times she cannot raise her voice because if she will raise her voice, she herself will be blamed by the family, society and the system. Eventually she will made feel in that way that in most cases women takes all blame on themselves. NGOs can work at certain level, they are already working. The question is when and how this hypocritical value system will change? 

I am residing in India, being working in social sector specifically with Room to Read: an organization working intensively for girls and women. I have seen several such cases. It's ironical but it's the bitter side of society. I just hope and wish collectively we are trying to do something in our capacity to change the situation; even may be a little bit we could able to do still it matters. 

Fingers crossed. Long path to go....
 
Thanks again for providing such a wonderful learning experience till now and setting the expectations on higher side now... :)

Regards

Swati Sharma

72:<hello! I'm Audrey from Oxford (not very exotic!). I'm very excited about this course, I'm joining a wee bit late, but aiming to catch-up :-)
I'm looking forward to exploring women's rights and health issues, gain a better understanding of the world and participate in the discussions here!>
73:<Gocalina, keep up with the great work you're doing!! :) 
Maybe the ones that hear your words don't dare to speak up because; they fear others will think they are not living up to the norms. But, they might still hear you. Or, maybe they will remember your teachings if their daughter gets beaten up and cries in their arms. Some of them might also learn about it via their daughters and sons and in that case, it surely doesn't hurt that they've heard it before from you. Learning requires repetition. :)
This is just a random idea but, could you approach the matter with more arguments from more angles? For example, can you try to explain them how harmful it is for the children's psychological development to see their mother falling a victim of violence and that a good mother would not let that happen? And perhaps try to develop counter-arguments to what they say by circumventing them, for example: "It is important to be respected and educated but, actually, being *really* respectful and *really* educated translates into being able to solve problems verbally. I'm sure you can come up with something much better. My idea is just that different people buy different arguments. 
Anyways, I wish you all the best with your work; keep up with the good spirit, even if change comes slowly!>
74:<Thank you for your suggestion! :)>
75:<That is a tricky issue but, some countries do better than others. I strongly encourage you all to take a look at Sweden and Denmark as marvelous examples were most women work full time AND families are valued and children are taken care of!

Some examples of their fair policies and habits: they have long paid maternal AND paternal leaves. Inexpensive day care and good free schools are available for everyone. The norm is to work around 38 hrs/week and if you need to work over time often, other people might think you're a little bit inefficient in your work. They have about 5 weeks of paid vacation every year. That leaves one with plenty of time with the family! In these countries, it's a strong cultural norm that families eat a healthy dinner together every day. Household chores are shared pretty equally and men are equal partners in raising and caring for the kids.
The prime minister of Denmark, Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, has two kids. I wouldn't be surprised if I heard that, at 5 pm or soon after, she cycles home like nearly every other Dane and enjoys her family time.

So, it IS possibly to have it all: equality, empowered women in the workforce, and loving families with well-cared kids. But, it takes serious effort and commitment from both spouses AND the society. :)>
76:<Dear Natasa, I study public health and the Balkans region and am interested in MANY things to do with it. I spent time in Albania as a Peace Corps volunteer and later researcher, and though I studied Croatian for two years I have not yet had the opportunity to visit Serbia (or any Former Yugoslav countries beyond Macedonia and Kosovo). I am going to check out your Women in Black Network, I believe I've heard of it. Happy to see you are representing your country/region in this course  :)>
77:<Great thank you :) I have netflix and will definitely check it out.>
78:<Dear Anne, thanks a lot for sharing your views through chapters of your book! It's awesome! I'm really inspired by the actions that courageous groups of women are undertaking all over the world! In Madagascar, there are also active groups of women like these, but they have to face lots of challenges: lack of education, lack of financial means, men's hatred, and so on. But we'll keep up the fight! I'm really keen to discover more hints and advice in this course, in order to help my sisters and country-mates overcome all their problems. Women rock! Cheers! :)>
79:<Hi Skye! I just noticed this this morning when I was checking the map and saw that we have a colleague from Israel, and then I realised there was anybody from Palestine... I totally agree with you and I think this is important to mention it, isn't it?
By the way? Are you Skye from Ramallah (Alejandro's friend?) :)
Hugs!>
80:<This is so cool! I had no idea, another great reason for living close to San Francisco :)>
81:<Hi Mona,
Thanks for sharing your views and providing insight. I am working in Girl's Education Program in India in Rajasthan State. You might have heard of the place. We are working in an integrated approach just in the similar way you have given the views. We are working with school, community, parents, girl, their siblings, local Govt. bodies along with the state level Education system. I myself feel that change is very slow process and it takes time.

Eventually in addition to academic support we are providing "Life Skill Education" to the girls (10 Life Skills recommended by WHO), that enables the girls to  take informed key life decisions and to negotiate with the people comes in primary periphery. Few changes are coming.

I would like to give one example. Attaching the link for reference (Page 11)-[enter link description here][1]

In Mewat region of Rajasthan, education for girls means religious education only. Mentality of Mev community is that girls have to look after their families and children; after marriage they need to understand religion and culture only no need to give them school education. Even in Mirjapur village till 2005 not a single girl has attended the Govt. School even the school opened in Mirjapur in 1971 only. After freedom of India in 2012 1st batch of Mev girls passed out 10th class in Mirjapur and Shabnam is one of them. 
In between Room to Read and AMIED started Girls Education Program and started a bridge course camp and enroll girls in that. Due to that initiative, today (in 2012) 781 including 376 girls are enrolled in Govt. school of Mirjapur.  
   Despite these difficult community situations, poor economic background, large family (10 members) and pressure for her indulgence in household chorus and agriculture work; Shabnam not only passed class 10th but also dreams to be an Engineer and now moving towards to turn her dream in reality.

These efforts turning into reality are one of the source of motivation.
I agree with you if work will be done in integrated manner, situation will change. :)

82:<Because of limited access to health and rude poverty (92 percent of the population is currently living with less than 1$ a day), Malagasy couples and family cannot choose or check the sex of their future infant. Nevertheless, the preference for a son is obvious in the whole society and results into various tragedies:
- more boys are sent to school than girls 
- boys are always considered as champions, "the future of the nation/family" while girls are always under-estimated and insulted 
- men easily access jobs and political positions (while it is proven that women are smarter and more productive) = corruption is widespread 
and so on...
A change of mentality, in addition to a strong women-related policy, is needed! Thanks again for providing great ideas, full of inspiration! :)>
83:<Hey, thanks, interesting thinking. Different people buy different arguments.I never though of it like that. Yes, we can try it. The point is that we should never stop. And sometimes it so hard ,and you feel so discouraged when you see how slow it goes. Somehow, these generations, the older ones are lost in space. They don't even understand their children. Children fit in the society because they go to school,and these women stayed lost in space. In the house the whole day, no education, state is not caring for them... It is very problematic. Now we are going to try through CEDAW comments that we succeeded to pass on to CEDAW Committee and he gave these comments to Serbia to push special programs for these women. They need psycho-social support. And government has to provide it for them. Regarding violence, here violence is normal. That is the point. There is an expression here, saying, stick came from heaven. Means beating up came from heaven. Is hard, but we should never stop. :) And these women cannot do it by themselves. We need to help them.>
84:<**I want to add here a post on the initiative against violence against girls and women, called: One Billion Rising - http://www.onebillionrising.org/** It is a great opportunity to raise you voice and dance! This is something that Ann talked about - to find and keep discovering beauty and agency within hardness and sadness. So lets dance!
http://www.onebillionrising.org/ - find you city here and join:)>
85:<Great recommendation! Thank you! I love adding new documentaries to my Netflix list :)>
86:<Hi from Brazil too! :)>

88:<Here, we have an example to follow: that of girls living in poverty who are full of ambition and powerful ideas:

> In *Girls Speak: A New Voice in Global Development*,
Margaret Greene, Laura Cardinal, and Eve Goldstein-
Siegel reveal that adolescent girls in poverty are acutely
aware of the obstacles they face, but are full of ambitious,
powerful ideas about how to overcome them.

(New Lessons: The Power of Educating
Adolescent Girls, Cynthia B. Lloyd)

Who is better than them to teach us how to face these problems? :)>
89:<I gained a great deal from the lecture, Professor Stacy explained the structure and process in way that I could understand really clearly, it makes much more sense to me now, especially in conjunction with the attachments about the United Nations structure and UN Bodies.  Also, how lucky are we all that Eleanor Roosevelt was around and in the position that she was.

I agree that Australia is much more fortunate than a lot of other countries, but this is slowly changing.  The examples that Professor Stacy used of her experience in Australia are very different to what she would find today. University Education is no longer free, and while we still have public healthcare, there is a strong push from the Federal Government for people to get private health insurance. We have enormous health, equity, and human rights issues in the treatment of Indigenous Australians, this has been ongoing since England invaded over 200 years ago, it is still unresolved. Our Federal Government policy and view toward refugees and asylum seekers is disgusting and clearly breaches the human rights of those people.  The Federal Government has just announced a royal commission into unions.  

But yes, Australia is a nice country and the sun does always shines. :-)>
90:<Goals 1 and 6 are imperative for girl's access to education. As we read in the readings this week, women drop out due to their basic needs not being met and the fact that girls are depended upon for their labor and other familial and community roles and skills. If girls do not have access to basic life sustaining needs (i.e. Goal 1: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and are highly susceptible to HIV via sexual abuse, human trafficking and female genital mutilation and cutting, or already infected with life threatening diseases  with a lack of access to healthcare, how can they have access to education (Goal 6)? It's not hard to see why education would be lower on the list of needs for these girls.

In answer to the second question, I think that beyond basic needs being met, the underlying notion needs to be that girls and women are valuable and hold human worth which is encapsulated in Goal 3:promote gender equality and empower women. Without this notion that women are of value, these systems of inequality and abuse will continue to exist.>
91:<Great observation Hopie2. One time I approached a young girl who was prostituting, I asked her why she was doing it, and if she was scared to die from HIV. The answer she gave me left me tongue tied, "she rather die alone than watch her five children die due lack of food'. Her husband had left her, he was the bread winner. Well, families are becoming smaller 2-4 children there is hope. I come from 8 children-:)It was not easy, the school fees was $40 or less per term but my parents could hardly afford, sometimes I would spend time out of school but my parents were determined to see me graduate from high school, that is all they paid for, I struggled to take myself to college saving every penny. I believe in education, it has changed my thinking, my reasoning, my view of the world, it has made me a better person. When a woman is educated the world is educated, impact the live of a woman you impact the world.>
92:<HI there,I think that they are both.  Girls are forced to leave school early as a result of practices such as early marriage and childbearing.  But girls who have no access to education also have higher rates of early marriage and childbearing.  Education of girls is linked to lower rates of childbearing due to greater understanding of family planning....or so is what I understand. :)>
93:<I know! When you see these stats and the actual and predicted outcomes does it not feel that the world is sitting on a winning lottery ticket and unwilling to cash it in?? :)>
94:<@ Rebecca...that is why I am concerned about where to post these responses to ensure they are accounted for :)>
95:<I cannot seem to access Piazza. Any help would be appreciated.  :)>
96:<They will send you a verification code so you can get into your account :)>
97:<This is extremely informative and breaks all of the education down in a simple way. This infographic enhanced my education in numerous ways. I have knowledge about AIDS/HIV but I did not know that "Women's Education has prevented 4 million child deaths in the past 40 years." Just shocking. Thank you so much for sharing :)>
98:<Hello! Welcome to the class? Where do you live in Maine? I went to University there :)>
99:<Thank you for Code of Conduct and I agree 100% :)>
100:<This weeks readings were so informative. I have previous knowledge of HIV/AIDS  having completed my one of my field placements at a Needle Exchange, but I did not know all of this beneficial. This will help my career and the clients that I work with :) Thank you !>
101:<Hey, 
If you guys are still having trouble, there are instructions given under the 'Discussion Toolkit' tab (top, far right). If you click that, it will give you the link to go to. From there, you can search for the course - it may prompt you to enter the code, which is also given on the Discussion Toolkit tab. 
Then you enter your email address, click the link in the confirmation email, and from there you should be fine!
Hope that helps! :)>
102:<It sounds like you have read the wonderful "Delusions of Gender" by Cordelia Fine. If you haven't I think you'll like it a lot, although you sound like you already know what she's going to say. :)>
103:<Thanks :)>
104:<so glad to see your feed back! let's keep on sharing further materials and tools related to women's health and rights, as we approach new topics each week :)>
105:<Yes, I have the same question as Chrissy does. Could someone please shed some light on this issue? Thanks in advance. :)>
106:<Hello, Anne. :) I just had a question about the course materials. I would like to earn a statement of accomplishment at the end of this course. In connection to that, I understand I have to complete weekly quizzes and a field assignment. What I'd like to know is if the quizzes have a rigid deadline on them or if they're going to be open until the end of the course. I couldn't find information on this anywhere; do forgive me if you've already put this up somewhere and I've missed it entirely. Thanks in advance for your time!>
107:<Thank you AliNF, I'm glad it helped! :)>
108:<I also agree with the code! I know a few of us would not agree with small things, but that's what makes us all unique in our own ways! And it's still nice to show respect and kindness to others. :)   I'm very much wanting to learn more in this course!>
109:<me too! :) i have joined just today and am doing the required reading>
110:<Is there a deadline for the quizzes or as long as we finish them by the end of the course we can receive the statement?

Thank you so much :)>
111:<My name is Shruti and I'm actually an Economics major at UC Davis! I love that Stanford provides these course because I look forward to interacting with others as well as learn about this topic :)>
112:<The process will be slow but through empowerment and changing social and cultural norms, the paradigm shift will begin taking place but it will definitely be incredibly slow because that is unfortunately their norm and their reality...but there is hope especially if we continue being their voice until they find theirs:)>
113:<I wish globally everyone was on this level of understanding, slowly, slowly I guess we'll get there. But ahh! How important it is to educate women! To a keep girls safe in pursuing education, and keep them in attendance. I'm not surprised by these findings, I just find them intriguing and so very interesting.  I believe educating women will make this world a better place :)>
114:<Hello!

Can someone give me a better idea on the "reflects" "fieldwork" and "meetings" and how to exactly get a grade for them?  I'm a little behind, working on week four and five this weekend and would just like a better picture on everything so I'm fully caught up.  Maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself but hope someone can give me a better understanding!  I would like to obtain the certificate of completion.  Thank you! :)>
115:<I really liked the point you bring up in your second paragraph. That the place of education is, or should be, safe, and therefore is helping to keep the girls from risky situations, violence, and potential early maternity. I had not thought of that aspect before! Thank you. 

I think it would be an interesting discussion to look at the safety of the educational institution. For example, in Canada, thousands of First Nations children, boys and girls, were brought to residential schools under the pretense of educating them. For the majority, what really happened was systematic abuse and attempted assimilation which has scarred the First Nations as a people for generations after. In talking about girls education, it is important to ensure that those providing the education are doing so in a just and appropriate way. I wonder what type of groups exist to ensure the fair provision of education.... Thank you for increasing my thoughts on the matter! :)>
116:<Thanks a lot Kirsten-Maria for this initiative, I have known about it in the Tea Time video with Anne, and I think it´s great. Sometimes I have these negative feelings when I come back from Gaza Strip, where I work with brave Palestinian women. We have been talking many times about the common need they (and me, but specially them!) have for self-caring strategies to be able to disconnect and recover force to keep working despite all the obstacles and barriers which face in their work. Some of the strategies I use and I have shared with them are:

- Stretchings and being aware of your body: other people have mentioned yoga and reiki, I do pillates and when I cannot I just do some easy stretching exercices in the morning when I wake up (5 minutes) and at night (5 minutes) before going to sleep, to have a rest from the "brain" and to feel my body and how I put my daily stress on my shoulders and neck, mainly.

- Finding moments in which you are in contact with the nature. It can be just a sunset, a walk in the countryside, or looking at the sea. For instance, in Gaza Strip, people go to the beach just to see the sea, an horizont that relieves them of the situation in which they live (Israeli blockade).

- Laughing. Also sometimes you do it also with tears in your eyes, and with contradictory feelings, laugh, laugh, laugh. Laughing strengthens the immune system, increasing the immune cells and antibodies, releases endorphines, improving the well-being, and relaxes your muscles, relieving stress and tension.

Hugs! :)>
117:<Thank you so much for your answer and for reading my post, Jille! I'm very glad you found this interesting :) 

I totally agree. I think it is an essential point to take into account, that when facing such big problems unfortunately some aspects that we don't reflect so much on because we understand they're so obvious, are actually key issues that need to be addressed and payed attention to...

And as you said, violence at the school place occurs all around the world...

I absolutely agree that it is something that requires more attention at all levels, may be starting by caring about school safety in our own communities!

Best wishes! :)

118:<I had a question about the quizzes and discussion posts. I would really like a statement of accomplishment for this course. Will a discussion posting about prior weeks' material or taking quizzes from prior weeks not count towards my final grade (and by extension, the statement of accomplishment)? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance for your time.

I want to say that I really am enjoying this course. It's so insightful. Thank you for putting it all together, three cheers to your entire team. :)>
119:<1. Education of couples about HIV/AIDS. From my point of view, it is very important to educate both partners about HIV/AIDS, discuss with them the necessity to protect each other and methods of protection (condom use).
During the sessions male partner can receive some knowledge about women's rights as well as some statistical data from his country, proving that men are usually in more favourable situation than women. Teacher can point out that this is not fair, and if he cares for his wife and future children, he should not be irresponsible. Group work can be also aimed at improving communication level between spouses, for example both of spouses can be taught how to discuss sensitive subjects, for example sex related issues.
2. Passing a law against early marriages (before 18). As a result girls will less likely have unprotected sex. According to the data, teenage girls in Africa an Asia contract HIV/AIDS when they get married, because their husbands are much older and had a lot of previous sexual relationships, and because condom use in marriage is not a usual and accepted thing. If girls will be protected by law till 18, they will more likely choose their peers as partners (because girls tend to fall in love, you know:), besides they will have more negotiation skills and more information up to this point. Some of them even may already have experience of relationships outside marriage, as a result they will know how to protect themselves from STDs and pregnancy.
3. Families must be obliged by law to send their daughters to school. In case they fail to do so fines must be imposed. Government should make education accessible in different areas of the country. Community support programs must be introduced in order to take care of ill people, while girls are out at school.>
120:<I  love the Human Rights perspective too! I think Human Rights are universal and it is nice parallel that this class speaks to so many women ( and I am guessing some men too :) from all over the world!>
121:<I have used the infographic as my desktop background for the last week and each time I see it, I'm reminded to come back to the course :)

In any case, it provides a snapshot of how the education of girls can make life better for all. The likely target audience though.. I feel as though an infographic of this will mostly be seen and understood (in the first instance) by whose who are already aware of these issues. In the end, those who are putting up barriers are not going to be the ones to see it. 

The messages could be tailored to specific geographical regions (and translated) to improve relevance to education workers and used as a targeted advocacy tool.>
122:<Hi, I'm Sarah from New Zealand, it's nice to meet you all.  It is wonderful to have so many people from around the world 'meeting' here!  I agree with the code of conduct :)>
123:<Hi, I'm from Brazil and a Doctorate student researching Shivaism of Kashmir, specially its confrontation with old patters of world-perspective, mainly founded in vedic sources and rituals. It's really interesting and sad seeing this traces of ancient culture still reverberating in India, but that also happens in all over the world - it just ain't so clear as it is in India, perhaps. Thanks for the personal experience written here :)

One sentence that caused a deep impact in me, when Reading these texts, was the one about the fact that to be born a girl is like a disease (healthwise) because this mere "condition" will mark the entire life of these been.>
124:<I agree. This chapter opened my eyes on two matters: the nature of poverty as a fundamental lack of freedom of action and choice and the connections between human rights, poverty and health problems.
And, as wee see throughout this course, many of the human rights issues are played out in the home: the son preference, who gets to go to school, FMG/C, violence against women etc.
I, indeed, really appreciate your phrasing for this: "Are our mother and sisters getting their rights" - and let's add grandmothers, too, should they still be alive! :)>
125:<It says that the final survery will be emailed when the course closes... whenever that is :) haha>
126:<Thank you :)>
127:<Hello Everyone!

I completed my course with a 99% and does anyone know when the Statement of Accomplishment will be sent or how the process works? Please advise :)

Thank you!>
