7:<I think you are off-base trying to to calculate this way :)
because what you are calculating is the energy we are getting from all the photons in range of small delta_lambda around 425 nm in 1 second and 1 m2 

the problem actually wants from you the specific energy we get from only 1 (and again only one) specific photon that has wavelength of 425 nm in electron volt :)

18:<how many kWh are generated each day?

How many days in a year?

How many years?

Now you should have the kWh generated by this system over 30 years.

Now calculate the dollars/kWh

AND, it wants the answer in **cents**/kWh ( not in   dollars/kWh)

(I just noticed that even these comments are being parsed. I tried to enter 
not 'dollar symbol'/kwH) and it got parsed into something unrecognizable) Anyway...

(of course this question ignores the lost opportunity cost of investing that $30,000 into something else instead of a solar array, but that is a different course...:)>

26:<I(lambda)=Power/(area*wavelength) from slide 3

=1000 (W/m^2) / 732e-9 (m) =? W/(m^2 wavelength)

I think some people are getting confused by I(lambda) units.

It is Watts per (square meter-wavelength)

Normally, m^2 * m would give m^3. But for I(Lambda) this has no meaning. What would a Watt per cubic meter mean?

It is Watts per square meter at a given wavelength.>
27:<My pleasure ;)>
28:<Hello,
The flux arriving to the surface in daylight is 684 W/m^2. This envolves half a sphere, that has a surface of 2*r^2*pie. It is the double of the cross section. This is why the flux is reduced by a factor of 2 when counting for the sunny sphere. 
I wonder where we take into account the different incident rays. Also, the average incident ray should be 45° that would give cos(45)=0.707, and not 0.5! 
Can anyone explain this?
Thanks :)>

33:<Hello,

A little bit late, but still, maybe someone can explain me how to calculate AIR Mass Effect. 
This is that I did:
Stanford university is 37 degrees North. 
In website "http://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.html" I entered date 22 of September (autumn equinox) and day time noon (11.52 AM). And as result I am getting suns altitude 52,6 degrees. As result Air Mass Effect is 1,26 ... But it is not a correct answer ;/ so where I am making a mistake? 

Be waiting for your answer dear colleagues ;)  
<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
34:<Didn't understood ;) but still I think you are too making a mistake ;)
we have to wait, maybe someone else will explain it in more details...>
35:<To Tom_T
Thank you for your contribution. I approached "VARIATION OF SOLAR RESOURCE WITH LATITUDE" with projection method, but cannot get the correct answer for "A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT!". I calculated the projected area as follows S=D*W Where D is polar diameter and W is width of our strange cell. Then I calculated total power incident by multiplying S by P and changed the units. Where are my mistakes?>
36:<thanks guys :)>
37:<Cool.. Now I know how to say Night and sun in Dutch!
:D>
38:<Done! =D>
39:<Gustavas, I'd say your answer is correct, but remember decimal values are separated by a dot in english, not comma :)>
40:<Hey guys!!! I did this:

 1. The total power intercepted by the panel is =P(E)=I*A=1000W/m^2  *  1.6m^2=1600W
 2. Next (for some reason) n(E)=P(E)/E= (1600J/s*lambda)/(c*h)=5.88x10^21... It was correct.

but units just doesn't make sense= ([J/s] * m)/([m/s] * [J*s])=1/s


Can someone help me with this?>
41:<If you have a constant input of 1000 W/m^2 it means that in an area of 1m^2 you will get an input of 1000W.

So what's the power (P) you will receive in an area of 1.6m^2? well... S*A.

The reason you divide 1600/E, is not because it's n(E)=P(E)/E. Knowing there is a constant input of 1600W, you already know, that in the period of a second, you will have a total energy input on the panel of 1600W*s, thus, 1600J energy.

So all that is left to do is, knowing a single photon has an energy of E, how many photons are there needed for 1600J ?

I hope my explanation is clear...>
42:<Can you please give some sort of hint? I have hit the submit button at least 100 times. These units are giving me a headache. Should Planck's Const. be converted in eV-S? Should 'epsilon' be converted from Joule to eV?

So I was correct-ish for the min, but the max is more like the min upside-down.

Not sure what we were supposed to get out of this, other than learning how to use the discussion boards.  That part worked for me. :-D

50:<Just small simplification - Assuming India's Energy Need Per Person are 1/4 of the US Energy Need Per Person and India Population is 4x of US . 

so 1/4 * 4 =1 , basis total energy need on US data and Area India's

68:<Got the coveted checkmark at last. I do not think your explanation is entirely correct as I ended up with wrong answer. The carrier conc. at 500K is not the doping conc. at 400K. It is the addition of that with another quantity (to be calculated) to arrive at the correct answer.

Thank you nevertheless for trying to help out. :)>
69:<OK.

Exposing the problem I have figured out the mistake in the case of using Joules as energy unit.

71:<I got the right answers for questions number 1 (doping type) and numBer 2 (holes concentration).

Still you have some things to improve. I understand that not all formulas and data are provided, examples etc in the videos - students must learn how to learn (I mean searching info somewhere online). But it would be so great to add more formulas and hints to slides. Especially regarding units conversion :)

92:<I see the need to integrate and calculate an area, but the physical meaning of the units is still a puzzlement to me as well. I was assuming we were generating a subset of the IsubL plot on unit 6, bottom of page 3 but not the case. Looking at the units, it does make sense you need to get to #/m^2*s by multiplying the two columns. The tricky part is the dE from the first column must be an approximation from the integral since you can't have midpoint with fixed levels of states.

This is where I took advantage of office hours in college that isn't applicable to this class :-)>
93:<I followed what you said. But logically you are multiplying a constant(band gap) with different values of number of photons in particular energy level(eV). So even without multiplying we can infer which energy level will have the highest power output based on it's corresponding number of photons value(whichever is highest).

But I am ending up with the wrong energy level of somewhere around 1.85eV.

Please explain :)>

109:<There is no mistake, I think you forgot one combination, just a tip :)>
110:<Alright, found it. Solar photocurrent video in Unit 6 came in handy. Good Luck :)>
111:<It states that a Si wafer with a band gap of 1.1eV does not give the maximum power output possible. If we LOWER the ***band gap***, we might INCREASE the ***photocurrent*** by including more photons capable of exciting an electron from valence to conduction band, but as the power output is a function of ***band gap*** and ***photocurrent*** (V(bg) and I ) we are not exactly increasing the power output altogether.

The question asks you to find the ideal band gap where the power output is maximum. You have to take arbitrary values of band gap (obviously not 1.1eV) and then calculate the total number of photons above each arbitrary band gap(i.e from the energy levels given) taken. Multiply the total with the arbitrary band gap taken. You therefore find the **power output** for that band gap. 

Repeat the above steps for different arbitraries and find that arbitrary which gives the maximum power output.

This is the best I can do for you. Nail it. :)>
112:<Please help, I cant understand part 1. Is dE=photon energy-1.1 ?
What I did is: find dE of photon energy that >1.1, then multiple with n(e). then sum them up. The result is: 6.3e23 which is wrong, I cant figure out why its wrong? Can some one help me on this? thanks a lot!>
113:<I am stuck in part 3 of Effect of concentration- Light. Apparently, I am in a fix as to which equation to apply to find the output power in either cases. A hint please. :)>
114:<Done... :)>
115:<I'm also having a really hard time with the first part in the "Ideal Band Gap"-question. I'm really trying to solve the assignment as you guys have explained it above (with dE*n(E)) but I think I'm having problem to understand  what dE is. As you write, it is the difference between two adjacent bands from column 1, but still I don't seem to get it right. Am I on the right track if I do it like this...:

(Column A row 5 - column A row 4) * column B row 5

 for all the rows and then summarize from the row with a value over 1,1 ev (in column A)?

Thanks :)>
116:<Carrier concentration is usually expressed for only the majority carrier. If the minority carrier concentration is under consideration, it is usually explicitly mentioned. The 'n' and 'p' symbols are used too. In case of an intrinsic semiconductor n=p and hence carrier concentration is used without any additional qualifier, but it again means the concentration of one type of charge carrier.

Hope this helps.>
117:<Thanks alot to all of you guys! 

I was literally pulling my hairs off my head.

For me, the major breakthrough was to realize the difference in the units!

125:<There is something wrong with that quiz, I think the right answer should be "Solution is Aqueous" + "Volume of Solute << Volume of Solvent" only

by trying many time the quiz is giving that the right answer when the solution is "when the solution is Aqueous" + "Volume of Solute << Volume of Solvent" + "Volume of Solute = Volume of Solvent"

132:<I don't know about your #1, but for #2 yes Li can be recycled and there are some programs around the world that will do it; however its cheaper currently to get fresh Li from mining than recycling.

For #3 - No batteries are close to liquid fuels like gasoline/diesel in energy capacity; but there is a saving grace that electric motors are 2-3x more efficient than direct mechanical drive of Internal combustion engine systems. That said fuel cells also benefit from the electric drive and can be refueled in about the same time as a gasoline car (3-4 minutes).

For #4 fuel cells can give the refueling time gasoline drivers are used to due to "recharging" is just providing more fuel which is hydrogen for the upcoming vehicles. Density of h2 is an issue, so its stored at very high pressures, and requires pre-cooling the H2 to fuel due to compression of the H2 into tanks generates heat. But combining that with the 2-3x improvement from electric drive with the high pressure storage and you can still easily store enough H2 to get 300+ miles per fill.

The above doesn't address the underlying costs of FCs vs batteries or of electricity vs hydrogen storage system etc. however :)>

135:<I do not think so, because there will be no more questions added to the course. Problem with quizzes was that some were supposed to be there, but Staff missed them and then they added them, and so on. Now there will not be any change, so go do your work and congrats :)>

137:<I just finished with final. I have 85% in total, wanted to get Distinction, but I just lost my nerves and made one mistake more than I should and it was due to the my error. I accidentally typed a wrong number. I was mad at my self at first, but now I am just happy it is over. 

Few words about the course:

I want to thank the professor and the staff for I have learned a lot, maybe more about the things I did not wanted, but there is never unnecessary knowledge. Yet, I have learned a lot and that is most important, but I am very disappointed with the final exam. I know this is free course and it is great and man is supposed to "torture" himself pretty much to achieve the distinction or even to pass the test, but again I think this was too much. I wanted it to be more about solar cells, and less about chemistry. I mean, I never had good chemistry in my school and I needed to "google" the Web a lot to find help for a lot of answers and yet some of them I did wrong because of human error. Like the others, I have other work to do, and in this part of year, a lot of work, so I did this tired and mostly during breaks, etc.

But I do not want to bother you anymore, I just want to thank everyone on this forum for the help and good hints and all I think about the course I will list in the Post survey, if there is going to be one :)>

But, I think the delay has something to do with re-balancing the grades to better reflect the course material, i.e. reducing the weight of the final relative to the problem sets, or something like that. Hence a manual intervention is needed. I guess we'll have to wait until people come back from holidays, and remember us ;)>
145:<Thank you team I got my distinction certificate :)>
146:<Thanks Dr. Bruce Clemens :)>
147:<Thank you Dr. Bruce Clemens for all your lecture, notes, exams and everything you provided through this course platform !

Above all thanks for the Certificate with Distinction :D :)

In the last, I would like to thank the support staff who helped Dr. Bruce throughout this course.

Regards,>
