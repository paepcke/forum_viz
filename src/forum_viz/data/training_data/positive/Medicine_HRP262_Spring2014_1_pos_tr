Sarah here from BMI :)
I'm also working through in R, and would definitely be interested in collaborating! I had actually just come on here to ask whether anyone had any tips on working in R - I haven't been able to figure out how to include time interactions in my regressions: I have tried using the pspline function but haven't had any luck. I think its a bit late now (for this assignment) to try and learn SAS, so any advice would be very much appreciated!>
