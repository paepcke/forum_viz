It's nice to meet you; my name is <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>.
Oooh, the Dominican Republic; that's quite an exotic place (from my perspective at least)! I'm from Scotland (which is a part of the UK) so we have fairly cold, wet and not so nice weather so I am fairly jealous of the weather you experience for the most part (hurricanes etc not so much!).

Hopefully we all will learn a lot from this course and I'm sure we will based on the value of effort put into this course (big thank you to the team) but I'm assuming people have the time and they put in the effort.

I hope you have a nice day and pleasant learning experience :).>
19:<Hello everyone, I am <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>,from Libya, but currently based in Kuala lumpur Malaysia, and hopefully moving to Singapore  before this course is over :)

45:<Hi Vatsala, you will have to get libxml2 and in addition to that iconv and zlib (at least that's how it worked for me on Windows 7). Check out this website: http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html

You will have to adjust your path variable for all three packages too, otherwise you'll get error messages when you try to use the xmllint command. Good luck! :)>
46:<What about removing the practice quizzes and the parts that have "No problem scores in this section" so as not to confuse anyone :)

Or maybe use another color instead of the glaring red that implies that there's something in error?>
47:<Glad it worked! :)>
48:<Well, it depends on your Operating System. XMLs and DTDs are plain text files so any plain text editor should do the work. In my Linux box I use Vim ;), but if you use Windows I'd recommend Notepad++. For MacOS, there is TextMate.>
49:<say, you downloaded and unzipped the course file "dbclass-script-files.zip" and assume now the  "Bookstore-noDTD.xml" file is in the following folder :
"C:dbclass-script-files". then you start the windows cmd window, and in the prompt window, type:
"cd C:dbclass-script-files"
this command brings you in "the folder where Bookstore-noDTD.xml is installed".
then run the xmllint.exe by typing:
"xmllint --valid --noout Bookstore-noDTD.xml"
and it should work. thanks.>
50:<EDIT: Fixed my problem. Had IDREF instead of IDREFS . The error report didn't help at all, though. :)>
51:<Thank you! now it runs ok. :)>
52:<You´re welcome, Allen :) You can also see YLei´s comment above, describing another good way to open cmd for a certain location. Lacking some really basic knowledge is clearly an obstacle for me in this course, but it´s good we have this forum!>
53:<Thanks Alex - I just had another look and there's no error :)

The conditions of the theta-join specify the join completely. I thought they were in addition to the R.B = S.B condition in a natural join. So in this question there's no requirement for R.B = S.B. Therefore the answer doesn't have to be one of the last two.

I just thought I'd clarify in case anyone else makes the same mistake!

It seems one of the earlier questions in the quiz has been changed to make this clear as well which is excellent :)>
54:<Cze?? :)

I'm from Poland as well, good luck for you!>
55:<Let's stop posting responses to this "Welcome Post", and instead, if you have a question, click on "New Post" and ask it via a new post. That'll make everything much more organized and allow other students to more likely see it and help you :)>

60:<I would suggest either Notepad++ or Sublime Text 2. They are both great, and offer code highlighting/color themes- which is really helpful. They also both support many programming languages, and are freeeeee :)>

63:<I am facing the same problem with this particular video. Text is to small to read and follow and clicking on the HD button doesn't seem to work. You are not the only one with this issue :)>
64:<Yeah I've taken two of the quizzes already and I've noticed that the possible answers sometimes omit the correct answer, or appeared to have two possible correct answers.  I'd say that is either because (1) the instructor wants us to rack our brain, that way we learn via trial, error and a bunch of self-querying :-) or (2) the script that pulls the questions was not written with logic to pull only one correct answer per question.  Admittedly it is a bit annoying when you couple this issue with the fact that we have to wait 10 mins to submit a quiz... but it is not at all a deterrent and I couldn't expect perfection for a free course :-)>

So.. if i'm doing an ID attribute, would i put "ID" or "InstrID"?

		         Instructors **ID** #REQUIRED

And then.. How do you do the reference? Where would the reference go? I've watched the video like five times, and gone through this tutorial (http://zvon.org/comp/r/tut-DTD.html#Pages~Attributes%3A_IDREF%2C_IDREFS) but I'm still so stuck :(

75:<It's fantastic that we have fellow "classmates" from around the world. Below is a link to a time converter, it could make the deadline conversion to own respective time zones much easier.

76:<Assuming you have downloaded the pizza.sql file from the top of RA Core Exercices, you should first install sqlite if not already down and not in your machine (for this I cannot help since I'm on a Mac).

Then you invoke sqlite providing a name for the new database:

    sqlite3 pizza.db

it maybe that it is sqlite our your system, not sqlite3

Then you import the pizza.db file in the pizza database in sqlite:

    .read pizza.sql

 You then may check that all is good:

    .tables

It should gives: Eats Frequents Person Serves

Now to ra. You have to create a pizza.properties file that gives pizza.db as database for ra. Basically it has this line in it:

    url=jdbc:sqlite:pizza.db

You should get rid of sample.db.

Finally you invoke ra with:

    java -jar ra.jar pizza.properties

And you can use all the relational algebra explained in the official page for ra on the pizza.db database

For this to work ra.jar, pizza.properties, pizza.sql and pizza.db should be in the same directory.

Hope this helps,
Michèle>
77:<hi MiCr,

i do think you do have to look at the other sources mentioned in the Readings in addition to the lectures (and the slides).

i agree that the XML question was somewhat "out of the blue", but i think the idea was to get the flavor of XSD, without knowing the entire spec. sometimes you have to work with incomplete knowledge :-)

normally in the "real world" you would come up with a DTD spec and write docs to it. in the exercises we have to reverse it to get an understanding of how DTD's work.

i'd suggest looking at the the dtd tutorial mentioned in the Readings. i found the zvon.org tutorial very helpful for the dtd exercise. 

also suggest getting the xmllint program and trying the exercises
locally on your computer.

hope this helps. best luck.

78:<The parenthesis in your definition act like a grouping.  What you will want to do is find a way to define that either &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lecturer&rdquo; are allowed and they are allowed multiple times.

The following:
> ((Professor , Lecturer*) | (Lecturer? , Professor*)

This reads as:
> (a profressor followed by multiple lecturers)
> OR 
> (zero or one Lecturer followed by mutliple professors.)

What you are looking for is:
> (A professor or lecturer) allowed multiple times.>

(see explanation above). Your declaration for the language element seems fine to me :)

Furthermore, this:

    <!ELEMENT city (name, population)*>

is more complicated than it needs to be - every city has exactly one name element and one population element, in this order, so there is no need for the Kleene star operator. However, this shouldn't cause an error.>

101:<Hi,
I fought a lot with Q2 before reading Q3 :)

The rule I wanted to write for Q2 is the following: the 'leaf' element Element_Name can take only one value - a string (#PCDATA) or the value of an IDREF's element. For example a book's author can be a ref 'Ident' or a string 'John Smith' if this author is not referenced.

But the syntax :

    <!ELEMENT Element_Name(#PCDATA | IDREF_Name)>

throw an error - ending star required with mixed content...

Is it possible to write such a rule?>

105:<Just curious if people are taking more than a single MOOC course and if so, how are they faring.

I had signed up for this database course as well as the Computer Networking course by Prof. David Wetherall on Coursera.  

However, with a full-time software job, I found it impossible to do two courses simultaneously.  The networking course has a huge workload, a bit more than this DB course, at least for the first couple of weeks.  

I dropped the networking course after the first week and am sticking with this database course.  I figure I might as well study one subject well, rather than be meager in two.  

Even with a single course, I am only watching the videos and doing all the quizzes and exercises.  I could do all the core and challenge exercises successfully so far (upto Relational Algebra, week 2), but they do require a fair amount of time and I have not been able to find the time to read the text as I had planned to.

I am a bit curious as to if there are others who are able to manage a full time job and do more than one course simultaneously.  Sorry for the long post.  :-)>

Lesson Learnt. [(Keep an eye on the deadline AND submit even of incomplete) or (complete when you have enough time before deadline)].>
109:<vchollati, many thanks (alas). Helps a lot. Will then take care of my child first and foremost today. Hope DB will keep a place for me in their relational universe, both (often) nerving and yet positively challenging :-)>
110:<Not checking it fully but it does say to start with "<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog..." which your post doesn't.

I noticed while doing the DTDs locally that what happens is that you add a link to your DTD from the XML-file and you also tell it what the root element is. So it can't even find the root element at the moment. Might be it, or I'm totally off. :D

117:<I know this sounds silly, but I have just finished the Relational Algebra Core Set Exercises and I just felt compelled to leave a note of thanks (already!) for everyone who had the trouble of setting up such a wonderful course. Learning the concepts from the lectures, the RA syntax, and then applying everything to solve the proposed problems... I really felt like I was back at school, I felt again, after many years, that indefinable (but unmistakable!) thrill I used to feel when I realized I was effectively learning something challenging and just plain awesome.

Thanks for the suggestions, I will take a look at those two.

I can also add [SQLiteSpy][1] to the list, that someone else suggested on another post. It's free and does not require installation... just an executable and an optional db file with config options. It's looking good to me, but I will review your suggestions.

Thanks!

127:<People over 30 eat cheese and supreme pizzas. The question is to find the pizzerias that serve only those pizzas.

The trick that worked for me for the RA exercises was to find the opposite of the question first. So:

1. Find the pizzas that are *not* eaten by people over 30
2. Find the pizzerias that serve the pizzas from step 1
3. Those pizzerias are not the correct pizzerias, so diff all pizzerias from the pizzerias found in step 2

Good luck with step 4 ;)>

129:<Same trouble :)

Moreover, there is the same problem with the extra practice for Movies exercises.

I guess that there should be a special algorithm of dublicates removal for such cases, but I haven't seen it in the lectures for this section.

132:<Much obliged :-)>
133:<Just solved it!  If you join the result set, with the two candidates who watched the same movie and rated it twice, with itself, and then compare the proper columns (e.g. table1.rID=table2.rID and table1.stars>table2.stars and ...[you figure out the other condition]) you can select the necessary columns, then use natural join operator and then the select again to pull the data you need... and BOOM!  the answer :-) This is why I like math, there is just something about the lack of objectivity, or grey, that will forever appeal to me.>

144:<Each solution choice is a pair of two numbers.  The first number is a number between 1 and 3 that identifies one of the 3 MVD's.

180:<Hello,
  I was recently given permission to join this course by my employer to gain some insight into the layout and setup of databases.  Naturally, the course is quite far along and I would like to try to catch up.  Are there any future dates planned for this course so that I can try to take it from the start and so that I can try to obtain the best information possible?  Are there tips for allowing me to catch up with this course? Will it be available after the last lesson?  Since there is little chance that I'll be able to catch up on all of the lessons and the quizzes before the closing time for the Midterm, I know that I will not be receiving a passing grade for this course.  If I take it again in the future, will the "failing" grade be overwritten? 

Sorry for all of the questions.  This is my first Mooc, so I am learning as I go!

186:<Hi Mmyc,

in order for `CD ->> A` to hold, the following must be true: For any tuples t1 and t2 that agree in their CD-component (i.e., `t1[CD] = t2[CD]`), there must be a third tuple v that also has the same value in the CD-component (i.e., `v[CD] = t1[CD] = t2[CD]`) such that `v[A] = t1[A]` and `v[B] = t2[B]` (B is the "rest"). If we look at the four given tuples, we see that they are all distinct in their CD-components: the CD-components are (3,7), (3,8), (5,7), and (5,8). Therefore, we don't need to worry about the MVD `CD ->> A` - it will always be satisfied as long as the component from the left-hand side of the MVD has distinct values for all tuples. To see why that is the case, we can just apply the definition from above: Let's assume we have two tuples t1 and t2 that agree in their CD-component, i.e. `t1[CD] = t2[CD]`. Because all tuples are distinct in their CD-component, we can conclude that the "two" tuples t1 and t2 we picked are the same, that is, we actually picked the same tuple twice; let's call it t (i.e., t = t1 = t2). If we plug that into the rest of the definition: We need to find a tuple v such that `v[CD] = t[CD]` and `v[A] = t[A]` and `v[B] = t[B]`. Well, we can just pick v = t, and we're done :)

If this explanation didn't help to clarify it, maybe you could post those four tuples you thought were needed to satisfy the MVD? Then it might be easier to see where exactly your problem is :)>
187:<Technically, you could compute all the inferred dependencies right at the beginning, and actually that's how I first did it. But I found it kind of confusing, since there are so many rules you could apply to every FD; e.g. you could apply some augmentation rule to one FD and then combine the result with another FD and apply the transitive rule and then... and then... how do you even know whether there are still more rules to be inferred? You might have already found them all and you don't even know it! Also, you might end up with a bunch of inferred FDs that you won't even need later on in the decomposition. Personally, I find it more convenient to calculate the closure of the left-hand side of all FDs and then just take it from there. But honestly, I have no idea if this is the best way to do it (probably not), but I haven't really found a good algorithm so far to compute the set of all inferred dependencies :( but if you happen to come across one, please let me know! ;)>
188:<What you actually did is you added tuples to satisfy the MVD `D ->> A` (instead of `CD ->> A`). I think this is what happened: You picked the first tuple t1 and the third tuple t3 (t1[D] = t3[D] = 7) and added tuples for the missing combinations and got the new tuples (1,2,5,7) and (4,2,3,7). Then you picked the second tuple t2 and the fourth tuple t4 (t2[D] = t4[D] = 8), added tuples for the missing combinations, and got the new tuples (1,2,5,8) and (4,2,3,8). 

However, in order to satisfy the MVD `CD ->> A`, you need to look for two tuples that have the same values in *both their C-component and D-component*. But there are no such two tuples. t1 and t2 agree on their C-values (3), and t3 and t4 also agree on their C-values (4). t1 and t3 agree on their D-values (7), and t2 and t4 also agree on their D-values (8). But no two tuples agree on *both* their C-values *and* their D-values at the same time. t1 and t2 agree on C, but not on D; t1 and t3 agree on D, but not on C; t1 and t4 agree neither on C nor on D; t2 and t3 agree neither on C nor on D; t2 and t4 agree on D, but not on C; and lastly, t3 and t4 agree on C but not on D. The MVD `CD ->> A` states: IF there are two tuples that agree on the CD-component, THEN there must be a third tuple... and so on. Since there are no such two tuples to begin with, you don't have to worry about the THEN part, i.e. there is no need to add tuples. 

Here is an example that will (hopefully) clarify it a little more. Let's assume we add a fifth tuple to our original four tuples; let's add the tuple (6,9,3,7). Now we do have two tuples that agree on their CD component: t1 = (1,2,3,7) and the new tuple t2 = (6,9,3,7). Therefore we need to add a tuple v such that v[ACD] = t1[ACD] and v[B] = t2[B], i.e. v = (1,9,3,7). And we have one more pair of tuples with the same value in the CD component: t1 = (6,9,3,7) (the new tuple) and t2 = (1,2,3,7). This is the same thing as above, but t1 and t2 switched roles. Again we need to add a tuple v such that v[ACD] = t1[ACD] and v[B] = t2[B], i.e. v = (6,2,3,7). And now we're done, since there are no more tuples t1, t2 that have the same values in their CD component :)

197:<According to the DTD, Library elements can only be children of Neighborhood elements, and Neighborhood elements can only be children of the CityInfo element. The CityInfo element (which is also the root element) contains one or more Neighborhood elements, and every Neighborhood element contains zero or one Library elements. So, to calculate the minimum, you need to compute minimum(number of Neighborhood elements in CityInfo element) times minimum(number of Library elements in Neighborhood element). For the maximum, you need to compute maximum(number of Neighborhood elements in CityInfo element) times maximum(number of Library elements in Neighborhood element).

203:<I had a similar problem, and mine was due to the fact that the contains() function takes two strings as attributes, i.e. contains(string1, string2) returns true if string2 is contained in string1. We can also do contains(*element*, *string*), which returns true if *string* is contained in the content of *element*. However, if there is more than one occurrence of *element* (as it is the case sometimes with `Prereq`), the contains() function doesn't work anymore, because now the *element* argument inside the contains() function doesn't return a single string, but several strings. There is, however, a way to solve the problem without using the contains() function! Hope this helps! :)>
204:<Thanks for the link, that looks great! :)>
205:<Hi Erin,

Keep in mind that you only need a 50% overall score to earn a statement of accomplishment, so it's still possible to pass the course, even if you only get a few points on the midterm.

That said, the material is cumulative, and can be challenging if you've never worked with relational databases or SQL before. 

Personally, I'm a "learn by doing" type — I think this course is best for learning about DBs at a (mildly) theoretical level, and it's most effective if you arrive already equipped with some practical experience. You'll learn faster this way.

If you want to gain some practical insight into databases, I'd recommend working through [SQL Zoo][1]. You can work through the non-challenge problems in an afternoon or a day, and a lot of understanding will intuitively emerge from that. 

Then you can come back for the next iteration of DB course and zip on through :-)

I believe you are getting an empty result because you are using the sibling axes. Therefore, you are only looking at courses with the same course title *in the same department*. You need a different axis to look at *all* courses (i.e., also the ones offered by different departments).

I haven't used the avg() function so far, and I have no idea why you are getting the output you are getting.

If you prefer creating a separate folder for your XML files 
all you need to do is swap the files current location for "BookstoreQ.xml"


In other words if the file BookstoreQ.xml is located in C:DBFiles.

To retrieve (for instance) all titles you would enter 

doc("C:/DBFiles/BookstoreQ.xml")/Bookstore/Book/Title

**TL;DR** -- **How can I create a multi-part query in a single statement without creating a new table to store interim results?**  

I split up the problem into several parts. First I created a table `twoRating` to store the output of a query showing how many reviews were done by each reviewer for a particular movie. The query output is grouped by reviewer ID (`rID`):

    create table twoRating as
        select rID, mID, count(*) as ctr
        from Rating R1
        where R1.rID in (select rID
                         from Rating R2
                         where R1.rID = R2.rID)
        group by R1.rID;    

Notice I renamed the column containing the count of reviews per movie per reviewer as `ctr` so I can reference the col in later queries. The contents of `twoRating` are as follows:  

    201|101|2
    202|106|1
    203|108|3
    204|101|1
    205|108|3
    206|106|2
    207|107|1
    208|104|1

We can immediately see that only two movies were reviewed twice by the same reviewer; `rID 201` reviewed `mID 101` twice and `rID 206` reviewed `mID 106` twice. To glean this info through an SQL query:  

    select rID, mID from twoRating where ctr=2;

which returns  

    201|101
    206|106 

Now we want to find movies which received better reviews from the same reviewer at a later date:  

    select rID, mID
    from Rating R1
    where mID in (select mID from Rating R2
                  where R1.ratingDate < R2.ratingDate and
                        R1.stars < R2.stars and
                        R1.mID = R2.mID and
                        R1.rID = R2.rID);

The result of this query is:  

    201|101

Taking the intersection of the two previous queries will tell us which `rID`, `mID` pair corresponds to a reviewer who reviewed a movie twice and gave it a better rating the 2nd time:  

    select rID, mID from twoRating where ctr = 2
    INTERSECT
    select rID, mID
    from Rating R1
    where mID in (select mID from Rating R2
                  where R1.ratingDate < R2.ratingDate and
                        R1.stars < R2.stars and
                        R1.mID = R2.mID and
                        R1.rID = R2.rID);

The intersection is `rID`, `mID` **201**, **101*>

243:<Thank you. :-)>
244:<Hi infisxc,

I think I figured it out. MVDs and FDs together *can in fact imply new FDs*. More precisely: If you have a set $F_1$ of functional dependencies, then the closure $F_1^+$ (all the FDs that can be inferred from $F_1$) *by definition* only depends on $F_1$ itself. However, add a set $F_2$ of multivalued dependencies to the mix, and $F_1$ and $F_2$ together could imply an FD that is *not contained in the closure* $F_1^+$. Most of the popular database literature seem to prefer to simply gloss over this fact (grrrrr). However, there is a great book by David Maier called "The Theory of Relational Databases" I came across a couple of days ago; it is available online (with Maier's permission): 

http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~maier/TheoryBook/TRD.html 

It is quite mathematical in nature, which, judging by your style of reasoning, I am sure you would appreciate. :)

Anyway, in Chapter 7, Section 7.4.2, Maier introduces what he calls "coalescence" (he calls it an axiom, but he actually treats it like a theorem). Here it goes:

**Let $W, X, Y, Z$ be sets of attributes. If $X 	woheadrightarrow Y$ and $Z ightarrow W$ where $W subseteq Y$ and $Y cap Z = emptyset$, then $X ightarrow W$.**

This obviously describes exactly the situation from exercise 12(e), where $W = Y = left{Dight}$, $X = left{Bight}$, and $Z = left{Aight}$; it follows that $B ightarrow D$.

Maybe staff can adjust this question? (Or the answer?) Also, for future runs of this class, would it be possible to at least *mention* that things like this can happen? Please don't get me wrong, this is a great course, and I don't mean to complain, and of course there are tons of details that cannot be covered. But I really think that it should be mentioned that MVDs can infer new FDs - this has caused a lot of confusion for me, and I believe for some other students too.>
245:<Hello: I keep getting "Empty Result" from my codes for these two questions, which are very similar and the hint suggests using preceding and following axes. 

Q2 (Course Catalog):Return course numbers of courses that have the same title as some other course.

Q3 (World Countries): Return the names of all countries containing a city such that some other country has a city of the same name.

My code is almost the same as the one in lecture: about books having the same titles. 

For example, for Q3 in the country database, I have:
...path.../country

    [city[@name]=preceding::country/city[@name] or 

        city[@name]=following::country/city[@name]]

Can anybody help figure out what is wrong? Thanks a lot.>
246:<:) Thanks, juanfs>
247:<Thanks. I made the change and it works now. However, I still cannot resolve the course-catalog question. I have this:

.../Course_Catalog
      
       [Department/Course/Title = preceding::Department/Course/Title or 
          
           Department/Course/Title = following::Department/Course/Title]>
248:<That's what I figured too, but how come 10,1,10 is correct? Surely, by this logic, if |A|=10 and is A connected to B with 1..1, then |B| can be no less than 10? I think I'm confused . . :)>
249:<In fact the "correct" answer did round in the wrong direction sometimes, you can re-check it for e.g. the Balochi language in Pakistan. While I might agree that one should round to an integer because the result should be the number of people in a certain country speaking a certain language which is an integer one should round to the nearest neighbor and not just round down (given the accuracy of the percentage values one should round to 10k or 100k or even higher anyway). I really think this is an error in Q10 that should be corrected, otherwise there should be a hint to round down. Sorting out the rounding - which means inserting false rounding - took me almost as long as wrinting the correct query with the correct rounding behaviour. 

Nevertheless, thanks for all the good work :-)>
250:<Howdy fellow programmers,

This may sound silly, but my brain usually has trouble with the simplest things. UML is nothing more than a modeling system, correct? If my understanding is correct, it functions primarily as a planning and mapping system for databases. Then, we can quickly look at it and convert to a different modeling schema. Is that the right idea?

Thank you! I'm big on understanding concepts so any discussion will help this info stick in my brain! :-)

I hope everyone is having a great day,

Alex>
251:<Yes the scoring in this course is a total disaster.  The Course info page says it's weighted by the formula T = Q + 2X + 3C +3E, but also says that there are 401 point in the class.  If you try and count up all the points on the progress page you get 416 points.  If you try and deduce based on a midterm worth 54 points and 7% of the grade you get 54/0.07 = 771 points in the class. (But is this the 'weighted' point score?  Dividing by 3 doesn't seem to get  anywhere near 401 points).  The progress pages is a disaster into itself.  You have to scroll up and down this giant page just to try and make sense of totals.  I'd take another crack at trying to make sense of the point system but I can't deal going back to a scroll mouse and calculator to glean no info. I can't remember the last course I was in where it wasn't absolutely clear how many points were left in a course and how well I needed to do to get a certain grade.

Someone post here if you solve the hardest problem in this course: how it's graded ;).>
252:<But why do the same 30 points than one gets for the ChallEx-CountriesXPXQ count 8% then? The grading system seems to have some (rounding or other) errors, at least it is obvious that 401 cannot be the basis of the percentage values for Quizzes, Exercises and Exams. For Quizzes, the 401 points seem to be the correct basis, but not for the core and challenge exercises.
Another example: The Movie-Rating core and challenge exercises count both 18 points, the core ex is listed with 5%, the chall ex with 4%. It might be that the percentages for challenge exercises are divided by 400 and not by 401.

But anyway, we can conclude that there are 60 points for the final exam, or whatever points there are in the final exam the exams ounts the eequivalent of 60 points out of 401 :-)>
253:<My insert statement goes like this

261:<What Chris is saying is that you need to modify your where clause within the delete statement. The where clause specifies which tuples to delete, so you need two conditions in the where clause. The first one should check if you're looking at the right tuple, i.e. the one that just got modified. You can use any key of the relation to do that. The second condition should check whether the grade of the modified tuple exceeds 12. It's really hard to give hints without just blurting out the solution... :)>
262:<I am currently working on the extra trigger problems (same data as in the social network exercises). Exercise 3 asks the following:

> Write triggers to manage the grade attribute of new highschoolers. If the inserted tuple has a non-null value for grade, don't permit the insert unless the grade is between 9 and 12. If the inserted tuple has a null value for grade, change it to 9.

For the first part, I just added a CHECK constraint to the attribute declaration; for the second part, I wrote a trigger. Everything works fine. However, the following query yields a rather surprising result:

    INSERT INTO Highschooler 
                SELECT ID+1000, name, grade+1 
                FROM Highschooler;

The tuples in the database at the time I ran the query is the original data, i.e. 4 students in grade 9, 4 students in grade 10, 4 students in grade 11, and 4 students in grade 12. You would expect that the above query would add "duplicates" for all students in grade 9, 10, and 11 ("duplicates" in a sense that it's still the same student, only having 1000 added to his/her ID and 1 added to the grade); the insert should fail for students in grade 12 because trying to insert a tuple with grade 12+1 would violate the check constraint for the grade attribute that says that grade always has to be between 9 and 12. However, this is not what happens. What happens is: *no inserts at all* and the error message "Error: CHECK constraint failed: Highschooler". If I modify the above query by adding

    WHERE grade < 12

I do get indeed 12 new tuples (4 for each grade between 9 and 11). Why does SQLite entirely reject my first query, instead of just adding the 12 tuples that satisfy the grade check constraint and rejecting the 4 tuples that violate said constraint? Can anybody please help me out here?

Thanks in advance!!!

UPDATE: Just for clarification, I realize that I could simply replace the check constraint that I added to the grade attribute declaration by a trigger that checks after each insert/update whether the values are in the correct range (and as a matter of fact, I did that, and it works). I still want to understand what's going on with the check constraint. :)>

So to answer Q3, I figured that I could find all pizzerias that serve (all pizzas - pizzas of interest), and then a simple diff of this from Q4's answer should give me what I want.

290:<First, I would like to thank you for the course. It was great opportunity to practice SQL and to learn XML topics - DTD, xpath, xquery and xslt. Exercises prepared by the staff was really outstanding - thanks again for them.

I see a lot of entries here in discussion forum asking what is the next step after completing this course. My proposal (as a SQL enthusiast :) ) is to study advanced SQL topics:

**performance hunting**

 - understanding of common implementations of basic operations (semi-join, anti-join, nested loops, ...) and its complexities
 - query plan analysis
 - best practices for indexing and effective querying
 - access, index and table level filter predicates, range scan, leaf node traversal
 - storing big data sets (hundreds of millions records) using partitioning (horizontal/vertical) and other techniques (e.g. sharding)

**advanced SQL**

- aggregate queries utilizing [window clause and window functions][1]
- subqueries (correlated vs uncorrelated subqueries, use in SELECT/FROM/WHERE clauses, subquery vs stored procedure vs VIEW from index point of view, performance and complexity)
- CTE and data manipulation (e.g. move records from one table to another within a single WITH-query)
- procedural languages (e.g. PL/pgSQL, T-SQL)
- stored procedures with side-effects in SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses in various queries with and without clauses ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY
- stored procedures with side-effects in INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries

**other**

- spatial queries (SpatiaLite, PostGIS)
- [anchor modeling][2]


It would be nice to see such online course here at Stanford Online or at Coursera. Unfortunately, I haven't found such, so there is no other way than to follow mentioned topics on internet and to practice on their own.
