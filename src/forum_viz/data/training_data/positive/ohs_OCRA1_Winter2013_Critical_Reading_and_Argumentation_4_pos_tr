0:<Thanks for the note, Delaney :).  I haven't done anything with the wiki yet.  Let me know (anyone) if you have cool ideas!  Often wikis involve how-to.  (Some of these tabs are default, so I don't necessarily have a plan for them - like 'Progress'.  But I can add new ones, so let me know if you have any ideas there, too.  Maybe I can figure out a 'philosophy in action' one that you all can contribute to?>
1:<I was trying to imagine what a wiki on CRA would be like ;) haha

But in all honesty, I feel like I would really use a Progress function. True, we don't have many assignments on a week-to-week basis, but still, I like the affirmation from seeing good progress :)

Anyway, an interactive Philosophy in Action sounds awesome.>
2:<(Hey earthlings! :)

(This came up in Skype and it occurred to me that it would make good discussion here on the CRA forum!)

Why are we (philosophers) spending so much time on this "are we real" stuff? I mean what's the point? I don't see why it's worth pursuing. Sometimes it just seems so pointless. I'm not saying it's pointless because I don't want to deal with it, it just seems like there are better uses of our time. Does knowing whether we're real equip us to go out there and help people?

And plus if we were to actually find out that we are not real, what are we prepared to do about it?

(okay that sounds really negative :P I'm all for meeting in class to talk about Descartes simply because you guys are super cool, but this is great food for thought ~Faith)>
3:<INCEPTION.

Also Lord of the Rings? :) we could *make* it philosophy-esque>
