0:<The text book made it seem like the answer was obvious, but it wasn't to me. I found this proof : http://books.google.com/books?id=-nhjxQwMtaMC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=why+is+minimax+f(x,y)+%3D+maximin+f(x,y)&source=bl&ots=k-qilmUaXV&sig=fS0Q-w9vegU4qqNfn9GNhydg3mA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ldZIU8y1LqacyQGThoGQAg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=why%20is%20minimax%20f(x%2Cy)%20%3D%20maximin%20f(x%2Cy)&f=false

Just to confirm, the same kind of proof works in an n-player setting as well ?>
