8:<I could not attach my concept map to this document but here it's what I wnated to covey through it:
the different experiences the interviewed students had were very procedural and detach from reality. For instance they remembered learning about algorithms, equations and formulas as well as math in scenarios that were not real. These experiences encountering math is such that their feelings about math were negative. They experienced anxiety,boredom; they felt that math was not for them. Some expressed they hated math :(>

13:<I believe already in what is being taught in this lesson, so I have already applied it with my children.

But one point Jo said, "So, we now know that

 **all students, maybe except, you know, those with a 
specific learning disability,** 

but all other students can achieve at the highest
levels in maths, in all levels of school, okay, right up to the end of high school."

So LD students cannot necessarily have the brain growth enthusiasm that all other students can have???  Sure they probably won't reach a high level, but is there no application of the same new mindset?

Jo, I hope you address this more.  Otherwise, your statement seems like a fixed category and LDs are out of luck :(

I wonder too if "normal" ones can have learning disabilities too but not so severe and can compensate.  Then where lines are drawn between normal and not can be a gray area.>
14:<I still remember the anxiety I experienced in the third grade when my teacher gave us flash card tests on basic math facts (and I am in my 50's!). I've always been fairly good in math, but hate being timed or rushed. It seems as though those flash cards would go up and down faster than I could read them, much less jot down what I was instructed to write (I also wore glasses and had trouble seeing, so that may have been part of the problem) - I don't remember if we were supposed to copy the problems or just write down our answers. I just remember the sick feeling I would get in the pit of my stomach! That's one reason why I hate "timed tests" of any kind for my students! I don't want them to experience anxiety related to math because they are fearful of the time constraints! Unfortunately, we are required by higher authorities to provide them with testing situations similar to standardized tests so that they will develop test-taking skills to help them score the best they can. :( That's one dilemma I'm hoping to resolve during this course! :)>
15:<I am having the same problem:(>
16:<I  have heard many parents say, "S/he is just like me with math."

17:<Original problem:
![enter image description here][1]

I think the point of this problem is to find the amount of money you "should" spend on advertising in order to sell the largest number of products, but this problem doesn't even ask for that. There is zero discussion of motivation, and really no reason to even read any of the words in this "word problem."


Revised:

Tell the students to get out a piece of paper, pick a number between 150 and 400, and write it down.

I now tell them, "You are a company that makes and sells t-shirts. Think of a name for your company and write it at the top of your page."

Once they have done that, I tell them that the number they wrote down is the amount of money that their company has. I tell them to put a dollar sign in front of it.

"Now, you need to make a bunch of shirts to sell. That costs 100 dollars, so subtract 100 from your budget. This what you have left over."

"Now that you have your shirts, the last thing you need to do is advertise them, so people know about your company and will buy your shirts. Choose how much money you want to spend on advertising from what you have left (you don't need to save money for anything else, but keep in mind that too much advertising isn't always good)."

"I am the time machine. Once you have decided what to spend on advertising, come up to me and tell me, and I'll fast forward one month and tell you how many shirts your company sold in its first month."

When students come up, I put their advertising dollars into the equation $N=-a^<zipRedac>+300a+6$, but don't tell them that's what I'm doing. I just tell them the result.

Now, I ask them to walk around and compare their sales figures with other people. See who sold the most shirts, and who sold the fewest. Try as a group to figure out what's the BEST amount to spend on advertising, to sell the most shirts.

I would then put a large set of axes on the board, x:[0,350], y:[0,<zipRedac>5000], and tell each student to come up and put a dot on the board that corresponds to the amount they spent, and the number of shirts they sold.

Only at this point would I give them the formula. I'd tell them that, using this graph, we have come up with an equation that shows how number of shirts sold depends on advertising dollars (or, depending on the class, actually try to fit a curve to the data). Find the maximum of this function to find the ideal amount to spend using our traditional methods (in the case of the "Business Calculus" class >

19:<I currently teach remedial math courses at the community college level, and I also teach high school students at a local parochial school.  I have also taught math to jr. high students with learning disabilities in the past.  I enjoy teaching math, especially algebra, but the students that come to my classroom have, more often than not, experienced many failures in math :(.  Many students had the experience of having a poor teacher that lacked enthusiasm for the subject and knowledge of how to properly scaffold.  Therefore, students that might have otherwise been successful in maths, instead lack the fundamentals to progress to more challenging coursework.>

22:<My sections are gone as well!  It only shows sections 1-4 which is disappointing. :(>
23:<We also have tried to do away with "Honors Geometry" at our high school which is basically not much different in content than regular Geometry but rather a way to group out the top 10% or so of the higher ability students. All the teachers were in favor of getting rid of it but the parents came in with the backlash and thus it still exists :( We do have a new administration team now so perhaps I will re-initiate the idea to get rid of it in light of this data we've seen.>
24:<When I was in school 40+ years ago I heard the message that I was good at math for a number of years, for a girl :-(
When I ran into some difficulties, the male teachers weren't interested in helping me. It wasn't until an older female teacher took me aside and told me  helped me for a few weeks and it got me back on track. It's very sad that kids are still getting this message.>
25:<This upcoming year, my principal has decided to assign me to teach an "intervention" math class. He will pick approx 10 incoming freshmen based mostly on test scores (I'm not sure what other factors he will choose) and place them in this class. He hasn't provided any guidelines for what should be taught in the class or the structure.

Given my position and my anti-tracking beliefs, I feel as though I must make the best of what I am given and would love to really not only challenge these students, but even make them feel as though they are in a "high" tracked class due to the material that they are given. Any thoughts or resources on how I can plan for this class??! It starts in about a month and I've got near to nothing. :(>

30:<I can try to do what I can, but we're about to start school here and I really won't have time to do much more than just worry about my own stuff...I wonder if there's any plans for what will happen if there just aren't enough people peer grading for all the responses at the beginning? :(>
31:<Another YIKES here. I missed all 3 & still do not get it :(>
32:<No credit for me, and I am a <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted> :(>
33:<I feel the same way. After I do the lesson and before I call a group, I walk around and watch the student's do their independent work. I try to pull students who I noticed were struggling on the current lesson first.  This is not the same set of students every time. Then I try to call over as many students as I can before the " exit ticket time.  I was not sure if this was the right way to do it. But if there are more than 5 students who are struggling I may assign a mentor. Now I am questioning the way I do it. I feel like I am grouping them without the title of the group.???  :( The students who do their independent work are able to grade their own work with the answer key, with a different color pen and then are asked to hand it in before they can work on center work.  The centers are student choices.  I have a tick tac toe board every week with different tasks they can accomplish. It ranges from "review" work to Challenge activities.  If the student wants to get a tic tac toe for the week they HAVE TO COMPLETE a challenge activity. This can be done with a buddy of their choice or independently.  At the end of the week all students have to make one tic tac toe for "credit" and then if they wanted to try to get more than one tic tac toe it is worth more.  :)  It become as a fun game for my students and they have the ability to work at a level of their choice and be challenged.>

42:<"I usually know I'm bad at math when they put me in another group." This is a statement made by Grade 6 learner recently to me. I don't believe in Canada that school admins are listening, and I don't believe that teachers are listening to these children either. I think everyone just thinks they 'know better'. I think that us parents have been deceived, and don't understand how damaging this action is. I think as parents we also have teachers to share the blame in devoting so much time to comparing ourselves to others, so much so that we now do it to our own kids. And it just keeps happening. :( I have no idea when it will change. I'm not a teacher, I'm a learning consultant.. I'm not admin, so I don't get a 'say' in how things are managed in the public school system. However, I am a parent, and I'm strong in my opinion that my children can do whatever they set their hearts to. Maybe that will be enough regardless of what the schools do around us. One parent's voice at a time can maybe change it? I have no idea.. I certainly hope so.>

44:<I couldn't agree more with the research on grouping.  I work in a school, however, where most support the idea of grouping.  In fact, each student has a grouping card where they are marked High, Average, or Low.  That card is used to place them in the next year's class.  The idea is great for creating homogeneous classes, but how does that impact teacher expectations when the teachers are able to see these cards with her class roll?  We also group students into accelerated math, ESL (English as a Second Language), and Special Education.  That can't be good for student messages. =(>

I agree that teachers often teach - not to the middle of the group but sometimes to the "least common denominator" :(  Unfortunately leaving so many of the students not being challenged!
