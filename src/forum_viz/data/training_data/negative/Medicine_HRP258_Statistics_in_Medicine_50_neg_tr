0:<Hi,
I do not understand how to operate on this platform...
I can not figure out how to submit my homework, I did not notice there where quizzes, I do not even see how to post a discussion post in the right place or how to view comments. I guess, I am totally lost... So could you please, please post a Video how to operate this? I guess, I got 0 Points on the first homework because I did not know that final check means submit :(. Help!>
1:<I accidentaly pressend Final Check in the First Homework without answering it at all and now it says I've used my submission!!!! :(

Is there a way I can fix this!!>
2:<can't believe there's no way to edit my reply :(>
3:<One of the problem in premature rounding is errors compound. Unfortunately when setting the autograder if the margin is kept narrow you can be perfectly right and have a wrong answer  if the problem was done with premature rounding or vice versa(You can be wrong  - in both cases the steps may be correct. In some Edx courses they allow you to enter answers with greater precision than the given decimal places (The Edx Autograder can be set up for this ie be accurate to at least 2 decimal places - so you can answer upto 4 decimals and still be marked correct)) and this can remove the fear of being penalized for being more "precise". In fact I automatically used that method  in the first HW  thinking it will be the same as in the other Edx platforms and realized that that method is not being used :(>
4:<Does any kind soul (or /and including the course engineers) know how to download the .srt files (for the captions) This way we can have the captions for the videos in offline mode. I tried to capture the .srt files using a YouTube caption downloader plugin in Firefox but it doesn't seem to work :( . If the course engineers could put up the .srt files on the wiki we could download them for offline use and would be of great help especially when we speed up videos for say revision (as the voices become chipmunkish when speeded up offline :) ). Also since many of us (who are non Americans) find the American accent difficult to follow at times - we have to replay a section repeatedly sometimes to understand what a particular word or phrase meant and also at times some word  is just unfamiliar wrt usage - for eg "N's" I was not sure if I had heard it right as that was a usage I was not familiar with and then finally understood that as "Numbers" ! This will sort out a lot of confusion related to such issues.>
5:<question #3: Technically, since there are no instructions on rounding st. deviation, the answer should be a) less than 1 st.deviation 75+/- 6.1=(68.9, 81.1). My answer was marked wrong and correct answer choice was b) 1 st.deviation, which is not, even in exp<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>nation it's ABOUT 1st.dev. I changed my answer (reluctantly) to get it right, but there either should be clear direction on rounding, or correct answer should be changed. Thanks.>
6:<I had accidentally submitted my homework by pressing"Final check" after having done only one question. .this is my first ever online experience. . I hope I don't commit any such blunders ahead :( 
Could you please also explain the difference between a Percentage and a Percentile. .will help me grasp the context better. .thanks. .>
7:<Isn't there any way they can verify that i was trying at that time but this online class had loading error? :(
This is so sad it affects the grade so bad! I have everything else perfect in first attempt and this one zero!>
8:<I had that problem, I thought it was until 19:00 and now I can`t submit.
I think I won't continue :(>
9:<Thanks a lot for your help Mike. 
I was going to try to load the file you linked into Deducer, but now JGR/Deducer is not working for me at all :(
I just updated my Mac yesterday and am wondering if that somehow is responsible for the issues I am encountering...
I added a new forum post describing my problem.
Thanks again for your help.>
10:<I have sent 4 exercises  to one of the TA's Mr Rajhansa. I am not sure if he has received them as he has not responded to my direct email nor to the message on this board :(. I  cannot upload to the wiki as it does not allow attachments. So I really do not know what to do now. I can make the .srt files as and when I complete viewing a unit as  I found that blind downloading it in a batch can cause considerable errors and wrong .srt files  for the relevant videos. I am happy to help but the limitations are there. I cannot post on dropbox and other cloud servers for security issues. If someone can help including them in the wiki they can tell me and I could send  them over to them as and when I do them.(I have done units 3-6 so far and could do 1 and 2 also but the remaining 3 could be posted as I do them though actually I am in a hurry due to personal issues forcing me to finish as much as possible early at a pace I am actually not that comfortable with but with no alternative practically possible in sight so hopefully I should be able to load them early which would be an advantage to others (A silver lining of a dark cloud ;).>
11:<Hi, Kristin,
I tried to figure out how the OR is calculated in the Homeworks Unit 2. 
In the case of placebo and tesofensine, there are three doses group of tesofensine, when calculating the odds ratio for 1.0 mg tesofensine, I guessed the OR=(42/4)/(13/32), but the result is not 31.5, did I miss anything here? 
thanks,>
12:<Hi Raj,

I think you are among the course staff. I'd like to ask that how will be the final exam? I mean, will it be like homework that we will be submitting it at our disposal or it will be a timed exam to be done in one sitting?

The problem is that in our country there is huge problem of power outages and we are seldom able to work continuously beyond one hour in a stretch:( So please tell me if the case is to do final exam in one sitting in a limited time, then I should look for ways to resolve this issue well in time.

best regards,>
13:<Greetings, 
Is RR Relative Risk, Relative Ratio or Relative Rate? 
Would it be possible to organize a reference file in which all the acronyms are spelled out and the formulas provided in a bit more detail? 
Finally, I'm lost with these person years: when and how do you cancel them out and how exactly should they be used? 
Thanks, from a student who's not doing too well in this course :(>
14:<Naproxen is the control drug, so its' effects will be our 100% in all cases. When you get a V/N=0.46, it means that V=(46% of N) - or that it caused a 54% drop.

Similarly, when you get V/N=4.2, it means that V=(420% of N) - or that you have a 320% EXCESS of heart attacks.>
15:<If you go to the example that starts at 3:59 in the video, you will see that the numbers that are used to calculate the odds ratios are left as fractions in the calculations. For the example at the end of the video, we do the same thing. For this example, take the 0.42% from the incidences of new cases (from Vioxx data) and divide by 99.58% the percent of unaffected individuals (from Vioxx data), calculated like this:(1-.0042)*100. We then divide all of this by .1%/99.9% (the odds of the Naproxin reference group).>
16:<me too. travel for work between 8/8-8/23 to mountain area, even bring solar generator can help the continue power, but no internet  :(
need to know if any other option? maybe can go to office and do the final exam manually in class locally before I travel away out of country?>
17:<I have  converted the subtitles from 3-8. I will send them to Mr Rajhansa .

I am currently doing module 8 so when I convert module 8 I will send 6-9.One thing is that the autotranslation especially of Dr Kazi's lecture goes haywire !! It  gives some weird autotranslation so when I upload if some person can edit them(who can touch type well). 

I unfortunately have developed  an acute cervical disc prolapse  so cannot type easily this week (and have loads of time because I am not operating :( but cannot do that efficient typing etc due to paresthesia and being in a philadelphia collar>

20:<Spine bone density is normally distributed in the population with a mean of 1.0 g/cm2 and a standard deviation of 0.10 g/cm2. If a woman has a spine bone density of 0.95 g/cm2, translate this number into a Z-score (i.e., give the woman’s distance from the mean in standard deviation units).


Z=1.0
Z=-0.5 Status: correct
Z=-1.0
Z=0.5
i said that because if we want to normalize one distribution we just do
 Z= ((X bar) -u)/sigma. an with the information from the probles if would be
 Z=(1-0.95)/0.1=0.5 NOT -0.5>
21:<I wish I saw this thread earlier. The hint lead me down the wrong path :(>
22:<Same here. Got those 4 questions wrong =(>
23:<Is it too late for me now? :(>

26:<The issue with your approach is that you assume that there are 10 diseased and 90 healthy people in your sample of 100. You cannot assume this, even though the prevalance is 10%, because there is non-zero probability that there are x diseased and (100-x) healthy people in the sample (x varies from 0 to 100).

For example, the probability of your scenario is (100 choose 10) * (0.1)^10 * (0.9)^90, because the prob. of each person being healthy is 90%. This turns out to be only 13%! The remaining 87% probability is spread over other values of x. The correct way of using your approach would be:

Total prob = sum for all x between 0 and 100 this expression:(Prob that there are x diseased people in your sample AND given x, prob that you would pick 20 of the healthy people to take blood)

= sum for all x between 0 and 100: (100 choose x)* (0.1)^x * (0.9)^(100-x) *
(100-x choose 20)/(100 choose 20)

If you do the math, you will end up with 12.2% again.

Hope to submit rest of assignments on time.>
28:<First, get the probability that someone is not HIV+ (2999/3000), which equals .<phoneRedac>67. As 1000 people contribute to one lot of clotting factor, you then need to calculate the probability based on all 1000 people = .<phoneRedac>67 to the power of 1000. In Excel, the equation looks like this =(POWER(2999/3000,1000), which equals .<phoneRedac>96. 

Then to get the probability of someone being HIV+ in the 1000 pool lot, simply bust out the 1-(a) trick. In Excel, it looks like this =((1-(POWER(2999/3000,1000)))*100) NOTE: This equation returns the percentage value 28.4 as requested in the question.>
29:<I completely agree with Doc.
In that way the percentage would be 5,82% which I got but was considered incorrect.
Even so that the exercise specifically tells you (bold) to consider 112 or more, so 112 is considered.
Therefore:
X~Bin (n=200,p=0,5).
Mean of X=100.
SD(X)=7.
What is asked is P(X>=112) which is equal to asking 1-P(X<111).
Then, if X=111 then Z=(111-100)/7=1,57 and from the statical calculator you get that P(Z<1,57)=0,9418.
Then: P(X>=112)=1-P(X<111)=1-P(Z<1,57)=1-0,9418=0,0582 giving a percentage of 5,82%.>
30:<I believe that problem lies in calculation based on the binomial distribution while the course authors are using a normal distribution to approximate p values.
I have written MATLAB script to calculate p values from simulation and from binomial, normal and t distributions.

    result=[];
    for c=1:xrep ;

        rv2=rv-1;
        rs=xflip-2*sum(rv2);
        result=[result,rs];
    end
    mean_sim=mean(result)
    std_sim=std(result)
    [mm,varbin]=binostat(xflip,0.5);
    std_dist=sqrt(varbin)*2
    p_sim=(sum(abs(result)>=xdif))/xrep
    p_dist_bin=2*(binocdf(((xflip-xdif)*0.5),xflip,0.5))
    p_dist_norm=(1-(normcdf(xdif,0,std_dist)))*2
    t =xdif/std_dist;
    p_dist_t=(1-(tcdf(t,(xflip-1))))*2


----------
My results for the same data as in the video was p=~5% calculated from simulation and binomial distribution, and p=~4 for t and z distribution. Binomial and normal curves are not identical and i think that is the source of difference.>
31:<Thanks for the response.
my system runs on windows XP sp3. i agree that the problems could be a deducer configuration issue.

35:<i´m not happy about you,specifically with the asnwers of the question 9 , 10 and 11 i answer the question 8 well. and i did all calculus to calculated SD with SD=(1/n-1)sum of(X_{i}- x bar)^{2}. the answer for the question 9 was important to solve the next ones. 
i suggest you revice your asnwer, i did all calculus carefully because i know the thing.
i did not get wrong i´m so sad.
plz help me i  this homework and the last one i got the worst grade and i have been doing the calcules very well..sad about your answer>
36:<look at this video when enlarged.... :-(>
37:<Yeah it's a bit unfair that getting 2/3 right is marked the same as getting 0/3 right :-(
But life is unfair! :-)  (And I had *all three*, but was careless when transferring my answers over - too tired).

As far as clinical effect goes, I think I would consider anything over 2.0 or under 0.5 as becoming significant - twice the odds of surviving a disease, for example, would really make a difference to my life!>
38:<I am a little confused about the calculations suggested for the pooled 2-sample ttest. In the video, we are given:

Formula for the pooled variance: $S_p^2=frac{S_1^2+S_2^2}{2}$ (averaging the variances) or perhaps rather $S_p^2=(frac{S_1+S_2}{2})^2$ (squaring the average of the standard deviations; this is the formula used in the video, although it seems to be implied that it is equivalent to the previous formula--see 20:35 of Module 1)

However, in my textbook (DeVore's *Probability and Statistics*), as well as in a number of online resources, we are given:

Formula for the pooled variance: $S_p^2=S_1^2(frac{n_1-1}{n_1+n_2-2})+S_2^2(frac{n_2-1}{n_1+n_2-2})$

None of the methods are equivalent however (although the textbook method is equivalent, of course, to the first video method when $n_1=n_2$): using the IQ case variances, with $n_1=10$ and $n_2=50$, we find a value of $S_p$ (the pooled standard deviation) of roughly 77.63 using the textbook method, versus roughly 79.03 using the first video method above and exactly 79 using the second. Which is the correct calculation?>
39:<Hi,
I think the wrong answer is provided. 
It’s significant at the 0.05 level, but not 0.01 level: 
T=(0.77-0)/0.23=3.3478,
 p(t<= 3.3478)=0.9971, 
for 2 sided 99% confidence interval: 2* (1-0.9971)=0.0058, 0.0058>0.005
For 2 sided 95% confidence interval: 0.0058<0.025 it’s significant.
What do you think?

J>
40:<also, after each question you can go check your progress to know when you have crossed the 60% or 90% mark! Im over 60...but dont think I can make it to 90:(.>
41:<The problem with % change is it makes values near 0 look huge. Example: unadjusted confidence interval is (-8.2, 8) with expected value of -.1. Adjusted is (-10, 8) with expected value of -1. This is a pretty small change in confidence interval, but a factor of 10 change in expected value. Saying that the adjustment makes 1000% difference doesn't give a good picture of the change.

Compare this with adjusting CI=(-2,100) E=49 to CI=(-25,75) E=25. Here there is <50% change but it feels much more significant.>
42:<Hi, I just finished my exam and I got 39.6% from possible 45%! But I started the course quit late, from 5th week. So I don't have enough score from homeworks and I have an average of 58% in total!Just 2% less :D

I know it probably isn't worth much in the real world, but I tried really hard for that.

But the course info page does clearly state "To earn a Statement of Accomplishment, you must score at least 60% in the course (above 90% earns a Statement with distinction). "

Initially i thought perhaps they just changed their minds about it, but the course stats pdf clearly shows 744 got a distinction.>
