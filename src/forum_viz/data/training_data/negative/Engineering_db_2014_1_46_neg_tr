4:<trying it again after a couple of seconds does not help if there's a problem with the code :(>
5:<I'm.. not even quite sure what to ask. I am so confused by this! Can anyone shed some light on the whole id and idref thing?

So.. if i'm doing an ID attribute, would i put "ID" or "InstrID"?

!ATTLIST Course Number CDATA #REQUIRED
		         Instructors **ID** #REQUIRED

And then.. How do you do the reference? Where would the reference go? I've watched the video like five times, and gone through this tutorial (http://zvon.org/comp/r/tut-DTD.html#Pages~Attributes%3A_IDREF%2C_IDREFS) but I'm still so stuck :(

please help!! and thank you in advance :) :)>
6:<Okay, so for number 3, the attribute in the xml document, under course, is Instructors, so should it be instructors in the !ATTLIST of the dtd as well, or should it just be attributeName?

!ATTLIST Course Instructors ID #REQUIRED 

or

!ATTLIST Course InstructID ID #REQUIRED

??

And then, how do i create the ref for it :(
Thanks again, btw!>

11:<In SQL Social-Network Query Exercises Challenge Level Q6 I have made two queries. 

* One to get the friends
* One to get the friendsOfFriends minus the starting Highschooler.

If i count the first and second separate (Sql with only friends -> run and than change sql to friendsOfFriends -> run)

* only the friends i get a count of 2....very nice
* only the friends of friends - starting Highschooler i get a count of 5...very nice

>>> so Happy --> No

If i do both at the same time in one SQL query with excactly the same F1 + F2:
from (select..... distinct count(friends) as F1....),(select... distinct count(friendsOfFriends) as F2....) and i print both i get:
>> 5 + 5 (friends + friendsOfFriends) = 10. 

>> But it should be 2 + 5  (friends + friendsOfFriends) = 7

16:<In Sweden we don't use am and pm, we use the 24h standard. The due time is not specified with am or pm which is very confusing!

20:<update Movie

I am unable to get the expected result. :( 

Can anyone help me fixing it?

Thank you.

Q. For all movies that have an average rating of 4 stars or higher, add 25 to the release year. (Update the existing tuples; don't insert new tuples.)>
21:<where r1.rID = r2.rID and r1.mID = r2.mID and r1.stars < r2.stars and r1.ratingDate < r2.ratingDate

Returns the number of the reviewer and the number of the movie and was easy enough to come up with.  However adding select name, title before it skews the answer.  Simple if you use the numbers  but getting the name and the title skews the results.  Badly. :-(>
22:<yes even i found that answer is wrong :(>
23:<Could someone, please, share an example or two of MVD normalization?
It is really hard to find it in the Internet.
I know it should be similar to FD normalization, but without computing keys. The only problem here - it's not working for me for normalization quiz :(>
24:<77.7% ...forgot to select the answer for a question I knew :( ... and stupid mistakes in 2 of the first 4 questions (that should have been the easier ones)...for the persons that didn't take the midterm yet: BE EXTRA CAREFUL ON THE Q1-Q4 :)>
25:<Technically, you could compute all the inferred dependencies right at the beginning, and actually that's how I first did it. But I found it kind of confusing, since there are so many rules you could apply to every FD; e.g. you could apply some augmentation rule to one FD and then combine the result with another FD and apply the transitive rule and then... and then... how do you even know whether there are still more rules to be inferred? You might have already found them all and you don't even know it! Also, you might end up with a bunch of inferred FDs that you won't even need later on in the decomposition. Personally, I find it more convenient to calculate the closure of the left-hand side of all FDs and then just take it from there. But honestly, I have no idea if this is the best way to do it (probably not), but I haven't really found a good algorithm so far to compute the set of all inferred dependencies :( but if you happen to come across one, please let me know! ;)>
26:<How do you get only these course titles which have taught by the chair of a department? The best I can do is get all course titles which are the same department where the specific one is :(>
27:<I also think there is some problem with Q17. According to me I marked the correct option but after submitting it tells me I GAVE AN INCORRECT RESPONSE. :(>
28:<The same situation. I've made two mistakes. Mistake in Q18 is only due to my inattention (mixed up two answer options, chose one that is actually nonsence). I considered this question to be quite straightforward, so I haven't carefully rechecked it =(. But I don't understand, why Q17 is incorrect.>
29:<Guys, that's not possible! Do you have any idea how to use this "."? I'd like to ask the same language if its persentage>50 or not, but when I put this dot in different ways, I've always got an error:( these ways do not work:

./@percentage>50,
./language/@percentage>50

etc. Please, give me a hint! I would appreciate it!>
30:<Hmm. Try to look at it this way. In order to prove that an FD holds, you need to show that all tuples that agree on a certain attribute (the one on the left-hand side of the FD) also agree on some other attribute (the one on the right-hand side of the FD). MVDs, however, only state that if two tuples agree on a certain attribute, then there has to be a third tuple that satisfies certain condition. At no point does the MVD try to enforce some sort of equality that involves the first two tuples (which would be needed to establish an FD).

I know this sounds pretty wishy washy. I've been trying to come up with a formal proof that shows that MVDs cannot ever have any impact of FDs, but I haven't succeeded so far :(>
31:<Thank you! I tried the following but still wrong :(  I guess i am kind of confused about how to write the Delete script
