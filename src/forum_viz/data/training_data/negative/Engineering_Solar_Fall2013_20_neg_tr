0:<hello 

the correct equation is     A.M.=1/cos?z=1/sina 

where ?z is the zenith angle 

and a=(90-?z)  is solar altitude

1:<Ok.

*Standard atomic weight of Te 127.60

*Standard atomic weight of Cd 112.414(4)

Take caree because, first it asks GW and second TW -here I lost a point :-(

And for the price ... use the fraction of Te, not the weight of CdTe -here I lost the second point :´-(>
2:<I have the same problem too, I only get 1.25 and can not found the right Air Mass Factor :(>
3:<I mistyped the density on one attempt, and I forgot to take into account the 10.5% efficiency on the other :(. Good thing we get 5 attempts.>
4:<Me too :(>
5:<After a first trial to answer the Fermi energy quiz (graded WRONG), in order to better understand I tried to reconstruct the calculation for copper Fermi Energy (7 eV) given as example in the lecture.
Using the formula for n given in the lecture 
(n=(1/3*Pi^3)*((2*m*eF)/(h_bar^2))^(3/2))
I calculated n equal to 2.27e54 in units of m^-3 (that result from dimensional analysis applied to the above formula:
m is expressed in eV*s^2*m^-2, eF in eV, h_bar is in eV*s
therefore n units are m^-3).
The numerical values are
m= 5.11e05 eV/C^2, eF=7 eV, h_bar= 6.58e-16 eV*s.
Using the above formula I got n=2.27e54 electrons per cubic meter.
Since in the lecture the formula used for n was n=4/(a^3), I calculated the value of the lattice parameter for copper a=1.21e-18. Google (http://www.infoplease.com/periodictable.php?id=29) gives the value of the lattice parameter for pure copper equal to 3.61 A° (3.61e-10 m).
Before trying to solve the Fermi Energy quiz, I would like to ask if anybody from staff could please explain where am I wrong?? Does the fact that the ratio of the value of the lattice parameter found by Google to the value calculated above is about 3e8 have any explanation?? Thank you for the patience of whoever reads this post and answers my question. And please excuse me for any mistakes and/or misunderstandings.>
6:<h/sqrt(2*m*ke)*1e12, where h is in eV.s, is giving me the wrong answer of 3.06e10 pm :(

Please would someone help me out.

Thanks, <nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
7:<hi,

ke=(1/2)*mv^2

p=mv=h/lambda

so, v=sqrt(2ke/m)

now you need to insert v in equation mv=h/Lambda

so lambda=h/(m*sqrt(2ke/m))

I used h=6.626 * 10^(-34) Js

good luck!>
8:<i think there must be a syntax prob which is'nt accepting the answer....because i have verified my answers many times , but still :(>
9:<my answer depends on which online calculator i use and they do not all agree! --  leading to a lot of red marks -- i cannot even get one to reproduce 1x10^10 cm^-3 using Ni=(Nc*Nv)^.5*e^(-Eg/2kT) and the values given in class -- any suggestions?>
10:<i have problems with this problem :(
i use the formula k=2*pi/lambda>
11:<I think I don't understand it... 
For the first question, I use one formula and the result is ok. In the second question only changes one input data and the formula that I must use is the same, no?
Well, I can't get the correct answer and I don't know what I have to do :(
Can anyone help me?>
12:<The equation of Ni=(Nc*Nv)^.5*e^(-Eg/2kT) don't work.
Instead please use this equation 
Ni=2*(kt/(2pi*small planck))^1.5*(McMh)^.75*exp(-Eg/2kt)
for part 1 and for part 2, please follow rayfix>
13:<Strange thing is, using the different equations Ni=(Nc*Nv)^.5*e^(-Eg/2kT) versus Ni=2*(kt/(2pi*small planck))^1.5*(McMh)^.75*exp(-Eg/2kt) gives me two different answers that are slightly different.

The other strange thing is that the numeric answer from either of these equations for 400K calculation gives me the wrong answer anyway. So no idea on this one. Got one last try left.>
14:<I get KE as 1.602*10e-16 J,
m as 9.16*10e-31 kg
Calculate v=(2KE/m) it given 1.87e7 m/s
And I'm trying to calculate wavelength ant lambda=h/(m*v)=38.78 pm
It's wrong(
I'm can't understand, where I wrong>
15:<X= ln(I/Io) / alpha,  convert cm to um, I/Io=(100-99)/100>
16:<I used Vbi=(Kb*T/e)*ln(NA*ND/ni^2) and got the right answer. Just have to be careful with units.>
17:<I have the same problem in part 2 also, I use  
Nv = 3.5·1015·T3/2 (cm-3)
Nc=6.2·1015·T3/2 (cm-3)     
ni=(Nc·Nv )^1/2·exp(-Eg/(2kBT])

Lp = 0.0012cm

18:<activation potential=(1.5 - result 3A), is it wrong,why?>
19:<Hi guys, stuck on this one too.. I feel I'm getting close though! May be you can provide some suggesttions....
Got 2D done so at beggining of 2E I can calculate the power for dissolving just 0.25Kg of 'gun' Then P=V *i We know P now and we are looking for V. We have to work out i, so we use B-V eq, customized for i instead of J (J=i/area) and since B-V has j and j0 I get rid of area. The issue I'm experiencing is that I have V from the Power equation and also V from eta=(V-Eo) inside the exponential... So not sure how to proceed from there... Any ideas?

Also Wiki has a shorter expression for B-V without exponential (under Limitting cases) but haven't tried that one...>
