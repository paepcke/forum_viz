0:<I am not being able to plot the data in Excel :( 
My problem is the data comes with Depth and Density on the same column. How can I separate into two columns ? I cannot 'grab' or highlight just one column, because both columns become highlighted. tried excel and Notepad.
thanks>
1:<As an American I felt that I've been left out. :(>
2:<Guys, could you please light me a little bit here?, 
The equation:
  
RHOBlog=(1-PHI)*RHOBmatrix + (PHI*RHOBfluid) 

looks like have an analytic solution like:

PHI=(27-(1<zipRedac>*RHOBlog))/17, 

The solution for it at 5<zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac> feet is PHI=<zipRedac>1729, and you are right when talked about negative values for densities greater than 2.7gr/cc, however I have serious doubts about the units, because we need to submit the response in SI units (MPa) right? have you an idea of it?

Thanks

3:<Yes, if you rearrange the formula properly you'll get:
porosity=(2,7-log density)/(2,7+1) I calculated it and answer is reasonable for shale rock (I don't know for this very shale, but shale generally should have up to 5%.>
4:<porosity=(2,7-log density)/(2,7+1); thats not what i got either

the equation in the .pdf file is;

Log density = (1- porosity)*Matrix density + porosity*Fluid density

let me replace the words with letters to save me writting it out long hand

L: Log density,
p: Porosity,
M: Matrix density,
F: Fluid density

so;

L = (1-p)*M + pF

multiply out the brackets

L= M - pM + pF

take the M to the other side

L-M = pF - pM

simplify the right hand side

L-M= p*(F-M)

so

**p=(L-M)/(F-M)**

so Porosity = (log density-2.7)/(1-2.7)>
5:<I have the same problem here
I put the difference between the theoretical and calculated Pb but it gave a wrong answer :(>
6:<My hydrostatic pressure at <zipRedac>0000ft is 30.48MPa so we are close.
They are asking for the magnitude of the overpressure. In this cas I understand is the difference between the PorePressure - HydroPressure.
For PorePresure the Professor is indicating to use the formula Phi=Phi0Exp(-BetaSigma)=Phi0Exp(-Beta(Vs-Pp)
remember Sigma is Vs-Pp, if you take the Natural Logarith on each side and resolve for Pp you get that
Pp=(Ln(Porosity) - LnPhi0 +BetaVs)/Beta.

Mohamed, I noticed you are talking about "theoretical and calculated"
You seem to be thinking theoretical Porosity (the exponential compaction trend) So I hope you are not mixing Porosity and Pressure as comparable quantities.
??>
7:<Mark_Kelley and comentators,
I have done the same I believe. I plotted Porosity based on the Exponential relation given for porosity change under 'normal'compaction.
Phi=Phi0Exp(-BetaSigma)
  Sigma coming from Sigma = Vs - HydroPressure
and compare to Phi coming from Phi is coming from the equation in Homework <zipRedac> (logdensity=(<zipRedac>-Phi)DensityMatrix - Phi*densityWater
Then when I plot them together, I see departures at various points, and its hard to tell which is the real operpressure onset. I see divergence at 6638ft and again at say 8473 ft and then a very significant departure, though shorter interval at <zipRedac><zipRedac>000 ft
Dont know what depth to pick !! ????>
8:<I did what u are saying and checked my values twice but I get one 6.1 and another 5.8 Mpa but both were wrong.
I think their is something wrong with my approximation in this part as my other answers were right :(
Thanks for your help>
9:<Hey my friend, you can't imagine how much you helped me, i am studying petroleum Engineering, and we never dealt with a large set of data before and Excel, and we about to Learn MATLAB this year, not to tell that English is not my first language, so this was hard, and you really helped a lot simplifying the problem, so thanks so much.


and about the **Pore Pressure**, i think we assume the pores are saturated 100% so pore pressure will be the hydro-static pressure which is the same for both cases, the Bernatt Shale Well and the Golf of Mexico.

**`Pp =(Density of water Rho = 1g/cc )*(g = 10m/s^2)*(Height of Hydraulic Column =5000ft for both cases)`**

Then,
**`Pp=Rho*g*h`**

i hope that was helpful.

Good Luck My friend :)>
10:<I like direct question and direct answer especial in mathematics.

you say Pp =(Density of water Rho = 1g/cc )*(g = 10m/s^2)*(Height of Hydraulic Column =5000ft for both cases)

this mean Pp for Barnett Shale and gulf have the **same answer**, why in HW1.pdf say this "use a density of 1.0 g/cc from the surface to the sea floor (1000 ft) and a density of 1.7 g/cc for the shallowest seafloor sediments.">
11:<jrbouma - like you, my initial answer was incorrect. I understand the over pressure is the difference between the calculated pore pressure and the hydrostatic pressure at 10,000 ft. For calculated pore pressure, I calculated 67.89 Mpa by using the equation for porosity (phi=(phi_0)exp(-beta*sv) rearranged to solve for pore pressure and using porosity from the density log for phi_0. Is this how you calculated pore pressure? i.e., did you use the density porosity in this calculation? For hydrostatic, it is simply .44 psi/ft x 10,000 ft x 1/(145.038 psi/MPa).

Thanks!>
12:<My initial answer to this problem was incorrect so i am seeking guidance. 

I understand the over pressure is the difference between the calculated pore pressure and the hydrostatic pressure at 10,000 ft. 

For calculated pore pressure, I calculated 67.89 Mpa by using the equation for porosity (phi=(phi_0)exp((-beta*(Sv-Pp)) rearranged to solve for pore pressure and using porosity from the density log at 10,000 ft for phi_0. For hydrostatic, it is simply .44 psi/ft x 10,000 ft x 1/(145.038 psi/MPa), so i assume my error is in the calculated pore pressure of 67.89 Mpa.

my rearranged equation for Pp looks like this: P_p=S_v-(ln ?/?_0 )/(-?)

Any constructive feedback on this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!>
13:<ah sorry, for travel time then;

n=((0.5*(dTs/dTc)^2)-1)/((dTs/dTc)^2-1)>
14:<me too :(>
15:<Same problem :(>
16:<Hey DanRea - thanks very much for the input. As you suggested, i was using the incorrect porosity values in my calculation of pore pressure. Using phi_0=0.386 and phi=(calculated from density log) per you suggestion resulted in the correct answer. thanks again.>
17:<Thanks Hcastorp ! spent 5 mins on Markdown. It is kind of intimidating to me :(
will take a look at latex later :)>
18:<Dear Luhur, 

first of all, read all the points below.
a) Compressional and shear sonic are in microsec. per feet. so to calculate compressional and sonic velocities convert them into meter / sec first 

b) calculate Poison ratio by using  **v=(Vp^2-2Vs2)/2(Vp^2 - Vs^2)** [ where **v = Poison ratio and V is velocity in m/s** . **Note** we cannot use delta as , we have to use compressional and sonic velocities that must be in meter per second)

c)Calculate **Shear Modulus G = rho * Vs^2** [ again Vs is shear velocity ] [ Result will be in Pascal and you have to convert into Mega pascal by dividing 10^6

d) young modulus E = 2 G (1 -v) [ v is poison ratio and G is shear modulus]

e) Porosity witch you have calculated correctly. 
f) then UCS from given formulae and finally calculate your difference. 

I believe you was either wrong in calculating velocities from sonic logs or was not taking consideration of units like usec/feet to meter/ sec or Pascal to Mega pascal. I hope you will get right answer. My result was between 25-15 Mega pascal in limestone and more then 70 in shale (which I was considering wrong first ) and they were correct. 
 
[Formulae can be seen at book page 63-64]>
19:<I use this formula for Poisson's ratio 
 v =((Vp^2)-2*(Vs^2))/(2*((Vp^2)-(Vs^2)))

and this formula for shear modulus 
 G = density*(Vs^2)/<zipRedac>000000

and this formula for E modulus 
 E=2*G*(<zipRedac>-v)

where  units are

(density----Kg/m3)
(Vp-----m/s)
(Vs-----m/s)
(G----MPa)
(v--poisson ratio)
(E---MPa)

and for porosity i use 2.7 for matrix.


And my answers were acceptable.>
20:<yes i had negative values too. but they have no effect on the answer.
anyway, negative value happen when the density of formation is lower than default value of density. this could be a drawback for the equation: p_log=(1-phi)p_matrix+ Phi* P-water>
21:<oh sorry my bad hehehe, i was very sleepy when i read this. and it's because i see people are using different value for the ?matrix. <br>btw when we calculate the E = 2G(<zipRedac>+mu) i think it should be divided by <zipRedac>000000 <br> E=(2G(<zipRedac>+mu))/<zipRedac>e6. i dont know i did that and i got the correct answer>
22:<Same here :(>
