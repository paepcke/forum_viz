0:<The book I have for this and another class on semiconductors (EE216) has very different density of states for Valence (Nv = 1.04e19) and Conduction (Nc = 2.8e19) for Si at 300K... you state in the Unit 3 lecture on Electron and Hole Concentrations that you calculated these, under the same temp, to be 1.83e19 and 3.22e19, respectively. I realize now that using the books # is why many of my pset answers were always incorrect :( Any idea why the constants are so much? Its not an old book (Neamen/Biswas 4th edition).>
