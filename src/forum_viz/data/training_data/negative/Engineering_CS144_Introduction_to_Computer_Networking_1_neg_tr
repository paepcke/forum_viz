0:<When I try to make a request to the first server from my local machine, the ec2 instance appears to hang. A wget request from myth works, so I thought I needed to add a security rule in ec2, but after adding the HTTP source 0.0.0.0/0 (making sure to apply changes), nothing changed. When I curl from my local machine, the POX output looks the same except when a packet is being set up, I see this error: 

    INFO:packet:(tcp parse) warning TCP data offset too long or too short 7

Looking at the pox source, the error is triggered from

     if (self.off * 4) < self.MIN_LEN or (self.off * 4) > dlen :
                self.msg('(tcp parse) warning TCP data offset too long or too short %u' % (self.off,))
      
The TCP packet data is long enough to parse the header.

According to wikipedia, each packet's data offset (which specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words) must be between 5 and 15 words.

What could be causing the invalid packet data offset?>
