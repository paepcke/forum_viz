0:<It seems kind of petty I suppose, but I like to read along with the video.   There are many errors such as  periods in the middle of sentences and the wrong form of a word like "to" instead of "too."  I find it jarring.   This last video was no exception.  :(  Having said that, I am loving the course for content.>
1:<Does anyone have suggestions for resistance training that isn't a "routine?"  I'm especially interested in the deltoids.  Is there anything that can be done as an activity of daily living for someone who has no rotator cuffs and needs the deltoids to take over, but doesn't manage to keep appointments with her exercise bands? :(

Thank you in advance.>
2:<I had seen this TED talk before but found it worth watching again.  With a few obese members of my family, I have often thought about why the docs kept trying drugs, surgeries etc to remedy the problem..........but never addressing why they could not seem to stop eating regardless of how hard they tried.  :(>
3:<Heat section lectures are still very low volume:(>
4:<In another thread attached to some module (I can't figure out which one because these notations seem somehow to have disappeared in two browsers) :( Corey said, *"If you find yourself breathing heavily (even if its not for very long!), you are likely dipping in to nonoxidative metabolism aka "going anaerobic".* "

I never breathe heavily.  Whenever I take a treadmill test, they stop it at 9 or 10 minutes because, if they didn't, I'd continue forever (well, that's a long time....).  :)  Anyway, I don't mouth breathe; I carry on conversations with the test's monitors, etc.  This past Saturday night I did fast Latin dancing for 4.5 hours straight, sitting down only for the ten minute break when the music stopped.  I don't know what deep breathing is unless I force it.

So, does this mean I never dip into my nonoxidative metabilism; or do I do so even though I don't breathe heavily?  Thanks!>
5:<I actually enjoy very much being in a jacuzzi in the beach! it's so great, especially if it is a bit windy outside. I am trying to figure out why I like hot water in a hot climate, maybe as other colleagues said before, my body will be cooling down after the hot shower and then I feel refreshment... but the nice sensation in during jacuzzi..maybe my body is relaxed or perhaps I am just a bit weird... mm I have finished the heat module but I cannot solve the mistery yet :( any ideas? thanks>
6:<Steve, I too am an airline pilot...actually a retired one (a year ago :-) I think we have adapted much to the higher altitude just from our constant life in it.  But thinking more about issues discussed in this module, I wonder how much blame of "passenger rage" in flight, can be placed on altitude sickness? :-(>
7:<One of the risk factors for AMS is being 'younger than 46'. I was thinking about this and realized that the same is often true for patients who are having a heart attack.  I have seen 75 year old individuals that do better (in the setting of heart muscle injury) than some 45 year year old individuals. The rationale is that an older person has more coronary collateral circulation (that has developed as a function of long term demands on the heart) that can feed the ischemic area. Could this be an explanation (at least in part) for the age related data? Could this adaptability be a function of angiogenesis that occurs as we get older?                  (I'm sorry if this is a dumb question :(>
8:<Okay.  I'm trying a different browser.  I've submitted a response twice and it hasn't taken.  I hope they don't ALL finally show up. :(

_______________________________

I figured it takes time for the body to react, mountaineerchica; but I'm wondering what the physiological cause is. Do you have any idea about this?

Just curious -- how many times have you climbed Everest?>
9:<Thanks for the information, Elayne!  I'm sorry for the mistake in name. I'd temporarily forgotten that this platform (OpenEdX) has the author's name at the bottom of the post rather than at the top; this is the opposite of any of the many others I've worked with. :(>
10:<Hi ! 

the Module 1 is not listed, i cannot see the video Vomit in the skies in the list on the left of my screen :(

11:<Ack!  You are so right. My apologies :(

I blame my diving expert. No, no just kidding.>
12:<Sadness because I'll miss this course/ Anne/ Corey a lot from now on :( I'd like to thank you guys for everything, I learned so many things I didn't even think about before taking this course. Also had tons of fun with Anne jokes, the story videos and so on.. Hope to see you all soon!>
13:<Yes, there have been many studies that show, for instance, that there are more accidents and less productivity in workplaces on the night shift.  If I remember correctly (and I may be wrong), the shift that causes the most problems is the graveyard shift (spanning late day and early night).  

Then, there's the problem of changing shifts.  This is horrible on the body unless done properly.  One should always go forward in time, not backward (daylight to graveyard to night, not the other way around), should stay on a shift for a *minimum* of three days, and have a *minimum* of three days off between shifts so as to acclimate.  Of course, everything in this paragraph is rarely done. :( 

You can probably see from the above paragraph why jet lag occurs mainly when traveling in one direction -- when going from night to day rather than from day to night.>
14:<I thank you for this information, Karl. :)  I think I might not have been clear in my question and I apologize for this.  My problem is that I don't understand how the floating feeling fits into the lecture on microgravity.  Enough time was made of it that it's probably important, but I can't see how it relates! :(>
15:<And Anne? And all the staff? Could you come back and stay for like... ever? :( I felt like we were so close and then you all just disappeared, I wasn't ready for that haha>
