0:<Hi,

The bootstrap will select the block randomly, can this question have a uniform result? (without set.seed first)
I didn't get the correct answer after 5 trials :(

Thanks,

1:<HI 
Thanks for the input. The I tried doing what you suggested. The problem seems to be that lm has issues with what my splinebasis is passing to it. I used a smaller matrix 10*6 to test as well, but fitting it with the inbuilt bs function. Following is my splinebasis() and lm calls. In splinebasis, i tried two way of giving output. One that is commented out give the first error I posted.  

splinebasis = function(xs, zs){
  mat1 <- as.data.frame(matrix(0, nrow=length(xs), ncol=3, byrow = FALSE))  
  mat2 <- as.data.frame(matrix(0, nrow=length(xs), ncol=(length(zs)), byrow = FALSE))
  lxs <- length(xs)
  lzs <- length(zs)
  
  for (i in 1:3){   
    mat1[[i]] <- xs^i    
  }
  
  for (i in 1:lzs){ 
    mat2[[i]] <- hs(xs, zs[i])
  }
  
  mat  <- data.frame(cbind(mat1, mat2))
 return(mat) 
  #The following was tried a the first option. 
  #mat <- as.matrix(merge(mat1, mat2, by = "row.names", all = TRUE))
   #return(mat[,-1])   (removes the row.names created)
  
}  


> slm <- lm(sy ~ splinebasis(s, knots))
