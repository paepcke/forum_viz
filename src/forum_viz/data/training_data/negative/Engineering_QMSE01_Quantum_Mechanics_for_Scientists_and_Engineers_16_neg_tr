0:<I made a very stupid mistake. Whenever you have two questions, and you got one question wrong. You have to reset to enter again. Please note that this time, the grader totally resets the answer and you have to enter the answer once again. I did it during the last try and got both wrong :(>
1:<In Q 1.2.3 Q1 answer, it was mentioned that
However, ?(z,t)=(kz)^2+(?t)^2 **IS a solution**.

I was puzzled for a while how this confirm with the general expression f(kz-?t) or g(kz+?t) r any linear combination of the two. 

But after substituting ?(z,t) in the L.H.S of the wave equation the result was zero and hence ?(z,t)satisfies the wave equation. 

But I was still puzzled how this ?(z,t) can be written in a way to conform with the general solution. After few minutes, I found out that one can write

(kz)^2+(?t)^2= 1/2*[(kz+?t)^2+(kz-?t)^2] which conforms with the general solution.

Hope this will help>
2:<I used the assumption that wavelength is much bigger than the slit, while doing math. Although i know it was incorrect. But did not know any other way to do math :(  I want to learn really... not quizzily ! - again the math i got was from googling. http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m309-03a/m309-projects/krzak/>
3:<I found this week's quizzes and assignment quite demotivating. Most questions seemed to rely *just* on memorization of a formula, and some *careful* reading of the problem statement. Didn't enjoy :(>
4:<According to the reasoning in the lectures, the *expansion coefficients* $c_n$ allow us to express $f(x)$ as a linear combination of a basis set of mutually orthogonal functions $psi_n(x)$ by using the expansion $f(x)=sum_n c_npsi_n(x)$, and can be computed as $c_n=|a_n|^2intpsi^*_n(x)f(x)dx$, where $frac{1}{|a_n|^2}=intpsi^*_n(x)psi_n(x)dx$, i.e. $|a_n|$ is normalization factor for $psi_n(x)$. Incidentally, it's obvious that no $c_k$ depends on the other $psi_n(x)$, $n
eq k$, but just on $psi_k(x)$ and, of course, $f(x)$ itself.

I imagine that it should suffice to say that the set of expansion coefficients is unique and thus can't be computed in a way that could give a different result (e.g. for non-normalized functions), but it'll probably be more convincing if I try to prove that here. 

Let's suppose a different set of coefficients $b_n$ for the same basis $psi_n(x)$, with at least some $b_k
eq c_k$. For instance, we might want to ignore the normalization factor and compute them as $b_n=intpsi^*_n(x)f(x)dx$, with at least some non-normalized $psi_k(x)$. The expansion using these coefficients would give some $g(x)=sum_n b_npsi_n(x)$. But if we claim that $g(x)=f(x)$, i.e., that the $b_n$ are an alternative set of expansion coefficients for $f(x)$, we get in contradiction. Let's see why. By using both expansions, we might then write $f(x)-g(x)=sum_{n}(c_n-b_n)psi_n(x)=0$, and premultiplying all terms by $psi_k^*(x)$, integrating, and considering orthogonality, we would get $sum_{n}(c_n-b_n)intpsi^*_k(x)psi_n(x)dx=(c_k-b_k)intpsi_k^*(x)psi_k(x)dx=0$, what implies $c_k=b_k$, in contradiction with the hypothesis that they were different. In conclusion, $g(x)=sum_n b_npsi_n(x)$ will always be different from $f(x)$ unless all the $psi_n(x)$ are normalized; or mathematically also if $f(x)=0$.

So, when some basis function $psi_k(x)$ isn't normalized, we need to multiply by $|a_k|^2$ when computing the corresponding expansion coefficient (or else change the basis to a set of normalized functions). 

Incidentally, we can't expect to use $b_k$ instead of $c_k$ and then be able to generate the remaining $(c_k-b_k)psi_k(x)$ from the other $psi_n(x)$, $n
eq k$, since these are all orthogonal with respect to $psi_k(x)$, and thus can't contribute at all to "fill" the difference. For this purpose, we can only "use" $psi_k(x)$, in other words, again, we can only use $c_k$ with $psi_k(x)$ when expanding $f(x)$. Finally, it shouldn't be difficult to prove that we can't e>
5:<I have always seen ONLY the first lecture ! noticed there were many more on the bar above the video and that is where the Quiz questions are too... missed them all :)

I guess no point continuing this course... No one answered my 'where are the quizzes?' question :(>
6:<I wrongly read the second term in the function as z^2/L^2 instead of z^3/L^3 and hence got the answer wrong!
Its still my mistake as I should have checked the normalization before submitting the answer! :-(
It would be nice if the font, especially for super/subscripts is a bit clearer! If you see the solution the ^2 (squared) looks almost the same as ^3 (cubed) in the problem.>
7:<can anyone please help me on these two questions, they seem to be similar and i cant get a hold on either of them :(
QUIZ 5.3.3 Q3 and Assignment 5 Q4>
8:<I am very sorry. My fault.

I don't know how, but I had forgotten everything about the final part of the 7.3.3 video. I should revise my own RAM :(>
9:<Page 17 of the slides "Lesson_19_The_L_squared_operator.pdf", titled "Eigenfunctions of L$^2$"

There it introduces the spherical harmonic $Y_{lm}(	heta,phi)$ as normalised eigenfunctions:

$Y_{lm}(	heta,phi)=(-1)^mcdotsqrt{frac{(2l+1)}{4pi}cdotfrac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!}}cdot P_l^m(cos{	heta})cdot e^{i m phi}$

What does "...which, after normalization, can be written..." mean?

Does it mean that such functions are normalised, so for any $langle m,l,theta,phi angle$ tuple it gives always a complex number that its modulus is 1? if not, what is normalised?>
10:<[$L_x$, $L_x+L_y$]=[$L_x$,$L_x$]+[$L_x$,$L_y$]=[$L_x$,$L_y$]>
11:<I screwed this one as well only to realize while watching the video again that the images shown did provide the clue. Huh! It's the 2nd consecutive week since i have fallen short of scoring a 100 :(>
12:<In the formula for Y_lm(theta, phi), shouldn't there be parentheses around the term, "2l+1"? By the time I figured this out doing the lesson, I was nearly out of time and tries on one of the problems. Oh, well :-(>
13:<Well you need to master Dirac notation where it is obvious.  $(A|psiangle )^dagger=(|Apsiangle)^dagger=langle Apsi|=langlepsi|A^dagger$.  So when moving an operator to the left to be inside bra we must take Hermitian conjugate.  But H is Hermitian so it can be taken inside bra vector to act on $psi_m$ which is an eigenstate of H with eigenvalue $E_m$>
14:<I tried this approach but didn't work for me :(>
15:<I did the Quizzes but I think it's not related to it .. I tried when Lz = 1 nm H12 = H21 = -0.004 and when Lz =10 nm H12= H21= 4.787 but both answers are wrong :(>
