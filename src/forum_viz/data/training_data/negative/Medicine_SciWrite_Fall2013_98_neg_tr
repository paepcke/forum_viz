2:<I have the same problem. I lost 3 points although I rewrite phrases correctly :(>
3:<And the synonym for has no? "Lack" is not 5 letters :(>
4:<The points made in this lecture is so strikingly different from what we (mostly Chinese students, I guess) previously learnt in classes (both in and outside our school)! And it seems I really need some "deprograming" as suggested in the last lecture.

We were previously taught that, more nouns would make the sentence "more formal", and we are also encouraged (by some teachers/instructors) to write "obscure" sentences with uncommon words (e.g. in GRE AW section).(I'm not sure whether the "obscure" suggest the same as that in the lecture, but using complex sentence structure *does* help to show a student's English ability (esp as a foreign language), for it requires a better grasp of grammar and vocabulary.)

BTW, I'm also having a tough time on the "publish or perish" things, too :(. Though I clearly know it's not necessarily the case, but people would see CV in the first place...:(>
5:<Me either. Can't download :(>
6:<more ruthlessly will be "One student passed the exam." but unfortunately both are wrong :(>
7:<I am a little confused by the option of 2 answers for some questions. I submitted a correct answer for Quiz 1.4, question 2 but then thought I had to put in a 2nd one. I thought what I was doing was saving my first answer, hitting save, putting in a 2nd answer, hitting save again, and finally hitting submit. I got the question wrong because the 2nd answer that I submitted was incorrect! :(>
8:<OMG. First time I answered "new", after that I answered "innovations", but correct answer was "new innovations", my God! My English is not good :(( Maybe it's because I'm from Syberia? Please give me more chance! :))>
9:<Even missing a '.' marks the answer as incorrect :(>
10:<Hi, I faced similar issue in my assessment. I had provided response in upper case and it got marked as wrong. While the correct answer is the same word in lower case. Exact same word but still case sensitive assessment ... Duh :( I lost a point there :(![for Question 1.<zipRedac>][1]

I agree, that these type of cosmetic points should be taken into consideration during assessment.>
11:<Hi, I faced same situation for question 1.<zipRedac>. I had provided response word all in upper case and the model answer was presented in all lower case. I can't believe that a word written in a different case can change a meaning :(
It would be very much appreciated if these type of nitpicks are ignored during assessment. Thanks.![Unit 1 _1.<zipRedac>][1]

12:<same as me :(>
13:<there is still 4 Hrs !
and i am the same as u :(>
14:<I confuse myself with the UTC time... 

Unfortunately... we all missed the deadline this time... :-(
But as was posted in september, 23:

> Your grade will be based on completion of quizzes (10%); Unit 1-3
> homework assignments (20%, due weekly for the first three weeks);
> essays/peer grading (50%) and a multiple-choice final exam (20%)

So, we can recover in other activities :-)>
15:<One more ... I was naively thinking the timezone used was the Stanford one (PST), which is the timezone I'm in as well.

:(>
16:<Yes, even mine just shows it for Quizzes 1,2 and 3. Did you read the note from Kristin saying they don't accept late assignments? So I am really worried how all this will affect our grade :(>
17:<Same for me :(
Thought it was my local time in Texas.>
18:<well, I wrote **catalyze** (first attempt) - it was wrong **x**, then - **accelerate** (second attempt) - wrong, too :(>
19:<I was thinking that the question of the quiz might contain two answers, and made a mistake :(.>
20:<In question 2.4 B Turn the following noun-verb phrase back into a single verb "offer a solution", the answer shown is a noun ??. Got a zero for my answer choices :(.>
21:<Hello, I have the same question. Is there anything that we can do to make it up? I did not want to drop the grades :(

Thank you for your attention.>
22:<Me too, I can not submit my answers....I think there is a mistake with the time :(>
23:<Hello,

I have the same problem :(>
24:<Right now it's 8:34pm UTC Time in Coordinated Universal Time) time, which is 1:34pm California time. The deadline is 7:00pm UTC, so we need to submit our homework before 12:00 California time. I also failed to realize it until now :-(>
25:<I'm so sad. I have had the same problem of you all. :( 
I had read the deadline was at 17:00 and I was thinking it was the time in California. Right now, I just read that it is written "Homework 2 is due by noon Pacific time tomorrow" in the message that was sent yesterday. Anyway, I think that the time written in the homework was really confusing.
I hope the staff consider our situation, because we don't want to drop our grades.  :(>
26:<me too, after working hard in the assessment, a pop up message of an Error appeared :(>
27:<Got back the marks from writing assignment 1. The comments of reviewer 1 are very helpful, and he/she gave me good marks for 4 of the 5 criteria (3s and 2s). But for clarity, I got a 0 - the mark for a blank or incomplete essay. That can't be right! It must be an oversight or a technical problem. But there is no way I can contact the reviewer, and even if I could, I haven't seen a way to correct any mistakes in the review. :-( Any helpful tips?>
28:<As with me for homework 3 :-(
I would like to add my answers to the work I have done.>
29:<Well, I guess here goes the distinction :(>
30:<That's the exact same problem that I faced! :(>
31:<I guess the model answer does not emphasize the usual form of  parallelism here. The sentence shares the subject "pond"  with the numbered list. ( Note this part of the sentence is a relative clause--containing a subject and a verb--as it begins with "that."). Notice if you make "pond" the start of a sentence you will get:(1) "Ponds have higher removal..." (2) "Ponds should be...." (3) "Ponds may require...." And it's clear how they all are related to "ponds."  Maybe others have a different idea.>
32:<Yeah I know :( I was just worried that the writer may get offended if I were to re-type what ever he/she already has written.>
33:<Thank you for extending the deadlines... I only missed homework #1... but I never got an email saying the deadline was extended!! :( And I only saw it now :( Was there an email message sent? We all log at different times so it's not guaranteed we will see a post in time.. is there a way I can still complete homework 1? Thank you for trying to accommodate to all the thousands of people in this course!>
34:<Agreed. Sh*t happens sometimes and you find yourselves not in control. :(>
35:<Exactly my case, and they are more peers like that... see "unfair peer grading" topic :(>
36:<Hello, Mewy.
Unfortunately, I got also confused about Homework 3 :-( Can you allow me to make the homework? 
Thank you!
With best wishes,

37:<My article was about measurement of moisture in natural gas. Any high school graduate with basic knowledge of physics and chemistry would understand it. In fact this is the main reason I choose this topic. Yet I land up with such feedback :(>
38:<I was just editing an essay and found that the score for clarity had changed from a 3 to a 0! I did not click anywhere near that box after setting it to a 3, just went back to amend a comment in the feedback window. I only double-checked the grades as I'd read other comments here about them changing.

I am now very worried that the same thing has happened to other essays I've graded. If that is the case I am very sorry :( 

I would gladly recheck the essays I've already scored to make sure. Is this possible? I hate to think someone has received a zero grade undeservedly.>
39:<I somehow missed homework 3 which is badly going to effect my grades as I joined late and could not submit even homework 1 :(

And now I have seen the deadline for all three homeworks was 15 Oct and I even missed that due to Eid in our country. Can I please get a chance to submit homework 3 and 1 ?>
40:<Out of the 3 peer reviews I received for my essay - peer 1 review is very good and has provided feedback with edits. My sincere thanks to Peer 1 reviewer.
Peer 2 and Peer 3 just graded the essay and left no inputs/feedback on the contents. Both these peers have rated style 1 and other areas as 2. I would have really appreciated if the reviewer would have provided some meaningful comment/edits. At the least, they could have given their thoughts on what enhancements can be done to the essay. What is not written/communicated is not well-understood by me :(>
41:<I submitted very early and graded immediately four essays, but I don't have a grade yet too :(>
42:<I was doing my review of the first essay I had to check and I hit the submit button :(

Sorry for that, I don't know what it implies ?>
43:<In a course with <zipRedac>0000+ students, you can expect incorrect editing. For a majority, this may be  their first experience with writing and editing. Mentioned in week 6 of this course:[ editors may ask you to do some changes. You better send them back a cover letter indicating the changes you made. If you disagree with the editor , you can clarify your point of view. So, even professional editors may ask for changes that you don't like.]It's frustrating when you receive non-helpful editing but don't underestimate the benefit you gain from reviewing your peers. I read an excellent essay while reviewing and that one has inspired me to go back and rewrite my own essay.>
44:<I used Chrome for android from my tab. This is the second time this happened :(>
45:<Besides the first submission of my essay, I have completed resubmitting it after one round of peer grades. Again as in round 1, of the 3 peers - only one of them have provided few edits to the text and the rest 2 have not provided any feedback and have graded fairly low. 
My essay is based on a very easy topic and contains not many scientific jargons. Yet, my second and third peer reviews have rated the assignment low. Peer 1 has rated it very high. Unfortunately, I loose since second peer rated it poor :(

My questions is -
a) do i have to resubmit my assignment again for round 3? If yes, then will the best score out of the 3 rounds be considered as final score or whatever I get in round 3 will be considered as final score? Please clarify.


On a side note - Peer 1 - thanks a lot for having taken time to read through the essay and provided the feedback.>
46:<I wish it calculates the average but it won't. I read in some thread the explanation of scoring system and they mentioned exactly what I wrote. I asked one of my friends who is also doing this course. He told the same thing. :(>
47:<Hi..
i am facing same problem.2 days are passed and still situation remains same.Time is really short.
error don't disappear. :-(

48:<I have the same problem as well. feeling helpless.
wonder why admin don't respond. :(>
49:<I understand that Raj but now only three days left and I have still not got response and my chances to improve are fading away:(>
50:<Same problem here :(>
51:<The same story :(>
52:<I can't even access anyone's work to review. I emailed tech support but nothing so far :(>
53:<I have graded like 5 or 6 essays but at the "assessment panel" and where I submitted my essay, it still claims that I haven't reviewed any yet! Help! I want to see the reviews of my own submission :-(>
54:<I'm stuck with a "Waiting to be graded" message... no marks, no feedback, no possibility of resubmit :(>
55:<Same happens to me. I have reviewed 4 essays and when I try to access the feedback on my own essay I get a message informing me that I have to review two more essays because I only reviewed 2 :-(>
56:<I can not understand how people that do not belong to a study field can give a 0  score when it is clear that they haven't undertand what it is written (funny comments). What a shame!!! Bad course colleagues!! it is not instructive at all. people do not respect the other colleagues' work :(>
57:<I reviewed 4 n it says 0. :(.>
58:<I accidentally submitted my HW assignment #1 to the #2 slot, and now it's too late to submit anything under #1. I understand if there's just no way to get credit for the first one, but is it possible at all to delete the one that's submitted under #2 so I can at least get credit for that?

Thanks for any help you can provide =(

64:<Hello,
I have the same problem :(. As I can read I am not the only one. I was able to save but not submit th essay. What can be done about thi problem?>
65:<I had a similar issue as a reviewer. I had the opinion that the essay I reviewed was great and gave it 3/3 in every area. I added the comment about what I liked and while submitting I saw one of the grades had changed to 1/3 :-(>
66:<I'm using a mac and everytime I hit "Delete" on my keyboard to cross out while editing. the page refreshes and I lost everything :(. And I'm not even sure if then that student essay got garbage or half edited content?

Anyone had the same problem? Please help!

I'm considering editing outside of that finicky text box and pasting my final edit in and hopefully the page doesn't refreesh before I hit submit. Oh it's a pain. I have read like a million essays and they disappear. So I keep trying new essays.

<nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted>>
67:<I had the same problem yesterday :(>
68:<me too have the same problem :(  
Can you please open it in the last week of the course ?>
69:<me too. I have waited for many days. still can't...today is the deadline for assessment... what should i do?? :(>
70:<I found exactly the same thing: I had given 2s and 3s to one assay that I worked on before I edited the essay. Right before submission, I found that the scores I gave automatically changed to 0s and 1s!!! Lucky I corrected those before hitting the submit button. I guess others have the same issue, so some students may get good comments but low scores :( 
Well, at least students whose essay graded by me will be happy, at least!>
71:<excuse me. I don't know how to highlight the pear grading to grade it. Could you show me please :(>
72:<They do not answer me. I submit my first work one day before deadline, and after that "wait for the grade" and the "error" messages appear. Then I submit my second work and it appear immediately in the Assessment panel. I am very dissapointed - tomorrow is the deadline but I have not the chance to peer review and get points for that assessment :(((>
73:<Dear staff members,

Despite having submitted my writing a few days ago, I'm getting this error when trying to peer review other people's assignment in the Writing Assignment 1 (and there's plenty of people claiming the same problem in the forum): 

'Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/ba076c1a6e4246f5b767c<zipRedac><zipRedac>60<zipRedac>b27d<zipRedac>9 . Have you made any submissions for that problem? If you haven't, please try making one.'

I sent an email to techsupport@class.stanford.edu yesterday but there's no answer yet, and the problem is still there :-(

If this problem is not solved, we won't be able to send our peer reviews in time, so please try to fix it as soon as possible and/or extend the deadline until the system is working properly. I'm really enjoying the course, and it's a pity that I cannot get a certificate because of such an error...

Thank you.>
74:<I think it may be due to the fact that you are doing it past the deadline. :(>
75:<I have submitted my assignment, but the problem is that I didn't do the peer grade. This is because the page about peer grade shows "Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/ba076c1a6e4246f5b767c<zipRedac><zipRedac>60<zipRedac>b27d<zipRedac>9 ."
I was not given any assignments from other students to grade. What should I do? :(>
76:<I still have flagged essay :-(>
77:<I have the very same problem. I suppose you as well have the notification under 'Writing Assignment 2' section like this: "Your response has been submitted. Please check back later for your grade."

And nothing regarding "you have to review 4 peers to see your grade".

It seems like the system does not pick up our essays for others to review :(

My question is [here][1], have it open, maybe someone will suggest something useful.

78:<Yes, it looks this is the problem. Every time you put a tick in the box "Unsure", the system does not recognize the essay as truly reviewed. :(>
79:<but it shows you have a second chance for submitting the essays:(>
80:<I'm sorry to hear that :( Seems like someone was not very attentive to your work and rather acted according to some "pattern" in giving the grades.>
81:<Thanks Michaela, I did, but then asks for e-mail and all turns red.  :( -T>
82:<I see that some of you share my doubts... When I posted my first essay, and I got essays to grade, I've spent a lot of time on them, especially one, that I gave low grades for. I tried hard to give some usefull suggestions. In my opinion, when I give low grade, I should give more comments. Imagine then my disappointment, when I got my own work graded - with almost no comments... :( I understand, when someone gives me 13 points, sometimes does not exactly have the idea, what to improve. But when someone gives me 5 points, then I rather expect my essay full of insertions/deletions/comments...>
83:<I would like to ask the staff if there will be the possibility of submitting one of the two first essays again. Colleagues that joined us later were given the opportunity to do past homeworks.

I did all the essays, homeworks and quizzes and English is not my mother language. Actually I've never taken English classes and I tried to do my best and almost achived my main goal: distinction. Meanwhile I had to travel to another country and did not have time to submit one of my essays again.

Would it be possible to submit one of them once again? I am about to submit the thidrd one again, but I think it will not be possible for me to get the 90% :(

I thank you all in advance>
84:<also me i got 89.5 % :( , i don't know if some way to calculate question number 21 from the final grade and like that we can cross the 90% and we receive a certificate with distinction.>
85:<Im sorry to ask about it, but I will =) I have 89% progress, it is almost 90% =) And I will not receive Statement of Accomplishment with distinction, right? But anyway thank you so much for this great course! I really love it and upset that it comes to end =(>
86:<I tried to take the HTA course but found it too late! They would not let me join. :(

I'll keep watching for it in future, though.>
87:<I also got 85%. No distinction:(>
88:<I've got 86.. :((>
89:<yes :(>
90:<I missed for homework 1 and my final grade was affected :( I got great scores in everything otherwise. bummer! Still a great course!>
91:<It's a technical glitch!!! I am sorry it happened to you :( email the class support, I noticed that while grading my papers, I graded the numbers, and then after commenting I looked back up and everything was zero! so I had to regrade everything.>
92:<It's a technical glitch!!! I am sorry it happened to you :( email the class support, I noticed that while grading my papers, I graded the numbers, and then after commenting I looked back up and everything was zero! so I had to regrade everything.>
93:<Happened to people with essay 2 also.  I guess they didn't fix it :(>
94:<Guys it is a pity that this forum is so overwhelming :( I hardly have time or energy to browse through all the threads. However I recognise something similar to my comment in what Diana said, and I am sure I have graded you 15! If it was me - it must have been technical glitch - there was one review where the system did not let me even finish writing my comment and already communicated it was done.>
95:<I know I was hoping for a distinction too :( 
That's unfortunate about their response. It's tough for 28,000 or even 4,000 that did the peer reviews, which is why I suggested making up on homework grades. Still, it's too bad for people that did all the homework in time and then had the peer review problem....>
96:<but I didn't know that :( I have checked more than 12 articles and now I won't get the Statement of Accomplishment?>
97:<I haven't :( there was no information that if you check 'I'm unsure about this score' box review isn't counted and earlier I saw feedback from other students so I thought everything is correct with my peer grading :(
there should be an explanation of this but earlier, I took this course for the first time and I simply didn't know this.>
