0:<I posted this yesterday but it disappeared :( anyway, I'm having a similar problem, but my serial ports menu is totally greyed out. Here's a picture:

Online I found suggestions to disable the serial port, reboot, and renable it (didn't work) and that it might be a faulty cable (it was working two weeks ago so it seems unlikely). Any other suggestions? In case it's relevant, when I hit the reset button the motor spins a bit and the LED lights.>
1:<This seems to occur more frequently at <zipRedac>7600 baud rate, but occurs at 9600 as well. When disconnecting the USB, the restart is often immediate. When closing the serial monitor window, Arduino will typically freeze for a while (nothing else freezes) and then the computer restarts. Any idea what may be causing this and how I can prevent it? I had about 1<zipRedac> restarts each during labs 4 and <zipRedac> :-(  Sorry, I should have mentioned this last week perhaps.>
2:<Here is a video of a negative dampening effect on the standard spring program of the Hapkit.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fRJPxQW0c][1] As you can see, the paddle is able to osilate for much longer with a lower spring constant due to decreased dampening.  It is very easy to apply this to any program, simply add the dampening function to whatever force you may already have. In this case, the code looks like:
 double b_damper = .33;
 double k_spring = 100;
 force =(k_spring*xh)+(-b_damper*vh);
