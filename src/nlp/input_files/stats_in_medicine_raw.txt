Welcome to the discussion forum! I\'m hoping this will be a useful place for us to discuss anything related to the course.\n\nLet\'s try to keep things productive by following a few guidelines:\n\n(1) Search before you post - someone might have already posted an answer to your question, and it\'ll be easier for everyone if there aren\'t a lot of duplicate postings.\n\n(2) Use the sub-forums, e.g. discuss Homework (without posting solutions!) in the "Homework" forum, and introduce yourself in the "Introduction" forum.\n\n(3) Let\'s try to interpret each other charitably, and treat each other with respect.\n\nLooking forward to working with you all!\n\nKristin

Dear Kristin,\n\nThank you, the set up for the course is great and I expect to learn a lot from it.  I have a question regarding auditing- I would prefer to audit this course and learn the content at my own pace. Is there a place where I need to change this in my registration for the course so it reflects that I am auditing this course?\n\nThank you,\nKinjal

Hi!\nMy name is VJ. I have a Bachelors Degree in Bio-Medical Engineering. I am looking forward to furthur my education in this course of statistics in medicine and hope to learn from all of you aswell!

I am Prasanna Simha M , I am a Professor of cardiac surgery. Biostatistics is a very important part of cardiac surgery and in fact many of the important statistical methods were first introduced into medicine because of cardiac surgery (The need to prove a high risk surgery was worth doing !!).So I am looking forward to learn  from this course and share this learning experience with my co students.

I am Anika,I graduated out of medical school last month and am now working as a house officer in chest medicine.I registered for this course to have a basic background knowledge of how statistics can be applied in medicine.I am also interested to see how I can perform on an online course because I hope to do a masters in public health in future,hopefully online.

If R is optional what software are we using to work out problems or do data analysis?

Hey all, \n\nI just got my bachelors degree in physical anthropology. I have taken basic and anthropological statistics. I do not have a medical background, but my genetics is pretty good.

I entered 73.4 and was marked wrong



That\'s a good point! Technically, a quantitative variable is one which can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. Knowing the optimism scores of everyone in the sample, I could meaningfully talk about the "mean optimism" or "median optimism" of the group. Note that this process wouldn\'t be as straight-forward if each person in the group had to pick one "box" out of agree, disagree, strongly agree, etc.\n\nThe distinction is a bit blurry, I admit! Consider this example: I hope we can both agree that temperature is quantitative, but I could argue that it is a categorical variable, with 180 categories or boxes or bins between water\'s freezing and boiling points! Note that I can make similar arguments for other quantitative variables as well.\n\nRaj

Simple question: is using excel or similar data analyzing programs considered cheating on the homework?

Hi Kristin\nI would like to thank you for all your effort.I am planning to get most out of it.Hopefully i will be able to keep up with my schedule\n\nHill

The homework problems involve simple calculations that can be done with a calculator or conceptual understanding. They do not involve analysis of datasets, so no statistical package is needed. \n\nExcel is discouraged because it wasn\'t designed for statistical analyses, and thus it is too easy to introduce data errors (such as "off-by-one" errors that can completely misalign rows of data). For more discussion, see this week\'s optional reading!

Calculate the standard deviation of the sample data (n=60).\nthe SD is iqual to calculated the square root of variance i didt it but it showed big red X.\nthe variance is (x-E(x))^{2} where E(x)  is the spected  value of x. i did all caluculus and then i got square root, and the machine says the answere is wrong!!1 can somebody explain me

"temperature is quantitative, but I could argue that it is a categorical variable, with 180 categories or boxes or bins between water\'s freezing and boiling points"\n\nmmm, that makes sense\n\nif that temperature example were on a test I\'m sure I\'d get it correct without a 2nd thought, but I\'d probably have to spend time thinking about the "on a scale" question\n\nI can see they\'re exactly the same, but somehow they seem different \n\nI\'m going to have to think about this some more\n\nthanks for the explanation

GeoGebra also has all kinds of plot functionality. It is free and online.

I just wanted to thank you for doing this. As an undergraduate and through the first two years of medical school I did econometric programming using SPSS (I had a double major of mathematics and economics). Those were the days of punch cards and tapes. Being 34 years out of medical school, I am interested to take another look at statistics. I continue to have the conceptual/qualitative understanding of the statistics that I read, but I would like to get back to a better quantitative place. I would also like to see where things have gone in terms of computer programming etc. Again, thank you so much.

I think it means count the age from the birth date (as we always count and its continuous). As other options are grouping the age etc. etc.\nNo doubt "weight at birth" also makes it continuous.

Hi Im Meera.Im a doctor based in Needham ,MA on a career break.Hoping to refresh my knowledge in statistics and appreciate and critically analyse medical literature better.

Thanks for the efforts and course is looking well organized and well prepared.

Thank you so much for pointing this out!  I was wondering the same thing!



t be a problem. We don

no, \n\nwatch the video @4:18\n\nshe talks about Birth Order and shows 1st, 2nd, 3rd\n\nso were you your mother\'s first child or second child or ...\n\nwhich might lead someone to ask, "how old was your mother when she gave birth to her first child?"\n\nor the shortened form of the question "Age at first birth?"\n\nand yeah, its worded terribly

When it says to enter the answer to one decimal place, do I round it to the nearest tenth or just keep it as it is to the first decimal without rounding it?

The inter-quartile range is the difference between the 3rd and 1st quartiles (when data is arranged in ascending order, the first quartile is the number that has 25% of the numbers to its left, and the third quartile is the number that has 25% of the numbers to its right).\n\nIf we arrange the data in ascending order, we have:\n-300, -15, **-14**, -11, -5, -4, -3, **0**, 3, 4\n\nWe can see that -14 has 20% of the numbers to its left (30% if we include -14 itself). Similarly, 0 has 20% of the numbers to its right (30% if we include 0 itself). Thus, -14 is the first quartile, and 0 is the third quartile.\n\nThen IQR = 0 - (-14) = 14\n\nRaj

t believe it, and when I taught probability I used height as an example of something that *obviously* isn't normal. What is the empirical evidence that height is closely approximated by a normal distribution? Is the assumption that height is normal just wishful thinking, hoping that the distribution is simple? Is it that we don't have powerful tests for distinguishing distributions from normal distributions?\n\nIf you want to claim that height is normally distributed, you have to start by discarding children from the population. Children would skew the distribution to one side. However, the adult population is obviously a mixture of men and women, and these subpopulations have quite different means (roughly 10 cm greater for men), and perhaps the distribution of heights within each sex is approximately normal. However, when you mix two normal distributions with different means, you don't get a normal distribution. In addition, there are many other natural divisions according to generation, country, race, and economic background, among other characteristics. Again, it can



but isn\'t the idea that you do multiple random samples ?\n\nso one time you do a random sample you might pick 5 short north korean women and end up with a very low mean\n\nbut if you randomly pick 5 people from all over the world and do that 1000 times, what are the odds you\'ll pick 5 women from north korea ?\n\nreally, really low \n\nso that puts you at the low left end of the normal curve\n\nso yes, you could get a low mean for height but the odds of that happening are extremely rare\n\nthe other extreme is also unlikely -- being able to choose from the entire world but randomly picking 5 guys from the Netherlands \n\nthe odds of that happening are really, really low and would put you at the upper right end of the normal curve\n\nthe most probable thing that will happen when you randomly pick 5 people from around the world is that you will pick one tall person from the Netherlands, one short person from western China, one "average" person from Canada, one tall person from somewhere else, and one short person from somewhere else\n\nof course sometimes you will get more short people, sometimes you will get more tall people\n\nbut if you do it 1000 times the "most average" mean height will be picked the most often -- the big bump in the middle of the curve

s only one question on the first homework unit where rounding vs truncating will give you a different answer (Unit 1 Set 3, Question F). If you took the lazy way like I did and just subtracted the female percentage from 100, you'll get 66.3, which was marked correct. If you actually calculate it backwards, (3279-1106)/3279, you

I do not quite understand the table of the first question before the submission. \n\nAt first, I think all the numbers in the table are outcomes. I am confused why only 12 outcomes are shown when the mentioned sample size is 60. However, I kept on computing the result. There is no doubt all my answers are wrong.\n\nAfter the submission, I found that the second column is "Frequency". Suddenly I understood the table. I think it could be much better if one vertical line is added before the second column. Then I can take the head as some weird things "(RR in breaths Frequency per minute)".  \n\nThanks!

m not talking about sampling.\n\nThe assertion made in the lecture, and commonly made elsewhere, is that the actual shape of the distribution of heights is normal, or very close to normal. This is the assertion that I believe is wrong.\n\nThe lecture also stated that IQ is normally distributed. Perhaps it is, since it is an artificial construct, and when it has been discovered that IQ tests didn't give the results the psychologists wanted, they changed the definition. Height is natural, and it

The median value being in the exact middle of your ranked observations, you have to rank your data, and then find the median value.\nAs you have 20 values here, the median is the mean between the 10th and the 11th value. If you had 21 values, the median would be the 11th (which would exactly separate data in two groups of 10 observations : 10 lower, 10 higher)

Height in a group of adults  would be normally distributed. Heights of children of the same age are normally distributed and so on and so forth.We cannot compare for eg grossly different age groups like neonates and adults.

elham, If you use the download link you should be able to download it there too since it is not from youtube.

I was able to understand that but I was having a different answer even after verifying it again. The middle 2 values were not -14 and -12 for me but they were -10 and -5. I am sure that I am wrong somewhere but am not able to figure it out. Maybe I will try for it sometime later. Thanks for the answer GDurantin.

m not sure if this will be discussed later (and I'm just starting out with statistics). As shown and mentioned, the political bent shows a bimodal distribution on the histogram. Should this bimodal distribution make it sort of wrong to try to find outliers by using a box plot? It seems that the box plot might acuse a potentially considerable chunk of cases that are part of the smaller peak. Can we do some sort of a segmented box plot or use some other type of method in this case? I realize that biology/physiology data doesn

Can someone please explain to me how the answer to this question is 10%? Most of the data seems to be with pulse ranging from 80 to 90 hence it seems to me the answer should be 90%



Thank you Kristin for this opportunity. I am looking forward to increasing my understanding of statistics in a practical and meaningful way. This is my first on-line learning experience and the first time I have participated in a discussion group.

To get the median value when you have an even number of values, add the 2 middle ones together then divide by 2 (in other words take the average). I hope this helps you. JaneM

You may need to upgrade your browser. Other coursera courses need Google chrome to work. JaneM

Only the first five columns represent the pulse ranging from 80 to 90. Each of the first three occupies approximately 0.5 part, each of the next two occupies 1.5 part. So the first 5 columns occupy approximately 4.5 part. Since 5 parts = 13.5%, 4.5 parts are about 12%.

i get this too. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling java but it did not help

Boxplots are not really ideal visualizations for bimodal distributions, as these are really visualizations of around a single mean and range.\n\nIf you want something more accurate there is something called a "violin plot"  which might be a more relevant visualization:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot ... Not sure if it is explored later in the course, but it\'s essentially a modified boxplot with a density distribution overlaid.

RE: @2:00 in the video.\nThere might be a little confusion in what should be considered continuous and what is discrete.\nFor example, weight is continuous by its nature, however, if measurements are rounded to a gram, then the data can be considered as discrete, because there is finite number of values weight (of a human body) in grams can have.

Thank for your course. I will try to follow it regularly.

hey,\nThanks so much for setting this online summer course.So far so good!

I think this is an important point (and it is one that might actually cause a little confusion on the HW, too). One thing that might be useful is to have a standard means of typographically communicating when a variable that is, in principle continuous, but is being measured (and therefore presumably analyzed) discretely. Using a decimal point, for example, to distinguish between 1, the discrete integer and 1.0, the real number.

Question 1.\nWhat is the absolute difference in the incidence rates of heart attacks for Vioxx versus Naproxen? Please round to 1 decimal place.\n\nTo calculate such a difference it seems like I should do the following 20/2698 - 4/2699 = 0.006. If I round it to 1 decimal place, it will be 0.0. Then, I got the doubt that incidence rate should be expressed as percentages, making the result = 0.6.\nDid I make sense? Which one would be the correct way to go, please?

t get the right SD.\n\nOther courses commonly use an individual submit button for each answer, especially when we are only allowed one submission.  It

Write down the values from lowest to highest.  Then draw a line between the 10th and 11th values.

I prefer the edX structure to Coursera.  YMMV (your mileage may vary).

It would be helpful if each question had a separate  Save and Final Check button (as in other courses on the Edx platform)  instead of the only one at the bottom of the exercise.I had a problem where I thought that I had saved the answers as I had a yellow marker stating that my work had been saved but not graded and I clicked every time for each question. I got suspicious because in the meanwhile I could not browse and then I logged on to the site from my mobile phone and could see that my answers were actually not saved because there was some communication error between my Modem and LAN card on my desktop whereas  my wifi was working .Thus if we have some problem either with the net connection or local computer we can easily think we have saved a lot of our work whereas it may not be so.At least with the individual save and check buttons for every answer we can get to know that our answer is not saved compared to the en-masse save button. I do hope that this thing can be resolved and thanks in advance.It will really help especially when we have internet or computer issues.

I agree also I faced a problem where I thought my work was saved but it wasn\'t as my net connection had a problem but the "answer has been saved" yellow box continued to be there with no way to know if it had really been saved)(and it wasn\'t !!)







Yes, this is the age of the mothers at their first birth!  :)

In other Edx courses  if we give a more accurate answer (for eg 66.27 instead of 66.3 ie if the answer shows a higher accuracy it is graded by the autograder as right whereas here it is marked wrong.Is it possible for that to be instituted ? I lost a point for being more accurate !I do agree that it is mentioned to write the answer as x.xx etc but at times this gets confusing as each question has a different requirement and accuracy for higher decimal places or above can be set  by the Edx platform autograder to avoid more accurate answers being marked as wrong.

I am working in Google Chrome, but unfortunately I have the same problem as Nusrat, meaning that quizes are not activated. I can watch movies, but nothing happens on the progress diagram. Any further solutions?



Having more attempts makes it easier to earn the certificate.  I suggest three attempts as a fair balance (like the Edx Quantum Computation exams had).

Submitted the homework, turns out rounding it is the correct method.

For exemple:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nThe median is 4.5 (the middle between 4 and 5).\nAfter you have two intervals left:\n\n - 1 2 3 4\n - 5 6 7 8\n\nSplit in the middle of each interval and you will get the 25th percentiles and the 75th percentiles.

If in a binary variable "n" is an even number, wouldn\'t then the median be 0.5? if 0 and 1 were equally distributed?

Actually I saved the video and it ran for the full 25.14 minutes

1. Am I missing something about the B&W plots? We have the IQR but we don\'t know the max or min values. It\'s the whiskers that have me stumped a bit.

hi, \nI tried to follow the instructions provided with this course to install Deducer. \n\nI\'m on Windows 7.  My first attempt was to download and run the installer, which proposed to install R 2.x on my system. As I already have R 3.01 and RStudio installed, I did not want to install R 2.x in place of or along side my working R setup. Therefore I cancelled this installation. \n\nI was able to use this command in R\n install.packages(c("JGR","Deducer","DeducerExtras"))\nto install the R package, but I could not get Deducer to run from within R using these commands (either from RStudio or R\'s own GUI)\nlibrary(JGR)\nJGR()\n\nFinally, I got JGR to run in a command box by making edits to jgrlaunch.bat\n\nNot easy, but it seems to work. \n\nWhen I tried to open CSV files in what is now called the Data Table Editor, I found that all my data appeared in only two columns, an ID column generated by R and then all of my data appears on the 2nd column.  When I open the same file in Excel, all of my data is in separate columns, as it should be. \n\nAt this point, I\'m ready to give up on Deducer.  It\'s not working well for me at all, and it seems it would be easier to just use R. \n\nHas anyone else had better experience with Deducer ?\n\nthanks,

Good point! A good rule-of-thumb is that in cases where the number of values a variable can take becomes very large (for instance, your example of body weight in grams), you can safely assume that the variable is continuous, and not discrete.\n\nRaj

That is correct, but if your dataset stores age as a positive integer in effect that is "age at last birthday" which as mentioned is ordinal\n\nActually you CS geeks should recognize that every system has a maximum byte length for numbers

The (.5)^1 is missing in the last equation of slide 89: "=10*(.5)^9*(.5)^1+...\nI\'m confused with the quiz number 2 answer (Unit 4 Module 4 Part 2). The answer key and the explanation do not seem to match. The first time I tried it, my answer was wrong. I changed my answer reluctantly and got it right. But then, when I read the explanation, it matched my first answer. Which one is right? Thanks.

The second error seems to be a problem with naming a variable "2". Is this your code?\n\n`2 <- data.frame(Var1 = NA)`\n\nIf you use just about anything else, it should work.\n\n`v2 <- data.frame(Var1 = NA)`

FWIW, I\'m using a Texas Instruments calculator, which draws its whiskers to the last actual data point short of the 1.5 * IQR value, and then plots each outlier as a point.\n\nI\'m assuming SAS does the whisker to 1.5 * IQR when there are outliers -- what do other major software packages do? (SPSS, JMP, R...) Do any of these let the user choose which way to do it?\n\nIs one of these ways considered "best practice?"\n\nAnd while I\'m asking, are there any other commonly-used definitions for outliers?

Using the 1.5 * IQR outlier "fences" on a Normal distribution makes anything a little more than 2 standard deviations out, an outlier. This means outliers will occur a little more than 4% of the time, in Normal distributions.

Actually I know hardly anything about programing but R reducer is a GUI type (point and click) type version of Right mimicking SPSS so it is not as difficult as it seems. In fact if you can load it most of the things are out of the box. I actually started to use it just yesterday following the tutorial in this course!

I know but problem is every question has a differing requirement. If minimal accuracy is specified (and I do know that the Edx auto grader does it)  it would be better. There is also another reason for it. In questions with sequential steps to be filled rounding can compound errors leading to different answers that can pose problems in the auto grader. This happened in another course.







10 cases per 500 person-years is the same ratio as 0.02 cases per 1 person-year, and also the same as 2 cases per 100 person-years.  I think if you read 0.02 as "two hundredths" or two out of a hundred, that\'s why it would be reported in that form.  (I hope this helps.)

Hello ,hope it is not too late to let u know me .this is Zanyan ,come from china,finished my bachelor in management,just have been USA for 2 month .This is my first time to have an online class .I am interested in statistics ,and wish to have further education.Nice to meet u everyone !

Hi Kristin,thank u so much for your help and hardworking.Hope to learn from u .This course is so exciting and interesting !

Please never mind my previous post.  I just found there are more to the lecture by click next.  My bad!

If you use median in the denominator unfortunately it does not lend it self easily for calculation.This is a problem of both the median and mode.Further processing of data (formula derivation) derived from this sort of division cannot be easily be done.



Hello ,everyone ,my education background is management ,marketing .So ,quite different.Nice to meet u !

t know how is the distribution of the subjects in this range. I means maybe all of then are next to 6,5. We can

So, when calculating variance/SD you divide by n-1 when you are estimating population variance/SD from a sample, when you are calculating SD for a bunch of numbers, you divide by n, fine.\n\nIn the case of data study, we are supposed to divide by n-1 (judging from the exercise), but are we really trying to estimate population parameter from a sample? I would think that study participants *are* the population we are studying.

kindly help?

I sorta get the idea of the 25 percentile and 75 percentile. But how about 10 15 percentile etc?\nsay the data set \n5 4 3 0 -3 -4 -11 -14 -15 -300\n\nhow do you calculate their 10 percentile number?

Repeating the assertion that height is normally distributed is not productive. Do you have any actual evidence for this assertion? Again, it sounds like wishful thinking, that you are now proclaiming is an axiom, a fact we should believe more than data. Have you actually checked that heights at each age are even unimodal even though you are lumping together very different groups such as boys and girls, who go through puberty at different ages?

m afraid you are confused. I am not talking about sampling. I am asking whether the distribution of heights actually follows a normal distribution. This has nothing to do with sampling. Sampling from a non-normal distribution many times does not convert the distribution into a normal distribution. It may let you construct statistics which are approximately normal, but it does not change the distribution. If you still want to talk about sampling, please make your own thread. I

New to the platform, but it seems if one has only two choices: Final Check and Submit, the Final Check option would not submit. I finished the homework, wanted to go back and review before submitting, hit the Final Check and that submitted the assignment before I was able to look it over. With only one attempt allowed, it seems that clearer instructions are in order.







0.0076/75 = 0.00010133333 = 0.01%\n\n0.78/75 = 0.0104 = 1.04%\n\nyeah, their rounded numbers aren\'t correct, but I don\'t understand your comment \n"I would just like to point out that 78/75 > 76/75"\n\nbecause even if you go by their wrong numbers  1% is greater than 0.02%

yes i agree, there is no quiz in module 6. i have finished the other quizzes.

The way to look at it is from around 8:47 of Module 5, Part 2 video where the professor says the 10th percentile "would be the value for which 10% of the data are lower". I would interpret this as `-15` in your data.\n\nThis gets a little complicated, and R recognizes 9 methods to do this. More on this at [the Wikipedia page about Quantiles][1]  \n\nTo illustrate, these are the 9 answers that R gives for the 10th percentile in your data example. The default is `-43.5`.\n\n`` [1] -300.0 -157.5 -300.0 -300.0 -157.5 -271.5  -43.5 -195.5 -186.0\n``\n\n\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile

It could be the incidence per 1 person, 100 people, 1000 people, etc.\n\nQuestion 2 asks for a %, but if you use the same % (per 100) calculation in Question 1 it is marked wrong.\n\nThis also carries through to Question 4, because Question 1 requires you to round the answer to one decimal place, which is enough to make it imprecise enough to give you another wrong answer for the Number to Harm.\n\nAlso, Unit 2 Module 4 1:20 - 2:10 and another seems to conflict with the rationale behind Question 9.  Perhaps a better way to ask would be why the odds ratio is the most proper way to present the data, rather than asking students to discern motivations behind it.

"I am not talking about sampling."\n\nDo you plan on measuring the height of every single person in the world ? If not, then you\'re going to have to take a sample.\n\nWhat kind of sample will you take ? 10 people randomly chosen from around the world ? 10 family members ? 10 people you work with ? Those would be very biased samples.\n\nWill you base your conclusions off one sample ? Or will you do many samples and compile the results ? \n\n"I am asking whether the distribution of heights actually follows a normal distribution"\n\nThat totally depends on who you sample.\n\nYou may, just by total random chance, pick a sample of people where a graph of each person\'s height forms a nice normal curve. But most likely that will not happen.\n\nYou may, just by total random chance, pick a sample of people where a graph of each person\'s height forms a straight line. But that\'s not likely to happen either.\n\n"Sampling from a non-normal distribution many times does not convert the distribution into a normal distribution."\n\nYes, it does, if there is variance in the thing being measured among the members of the sample.\n\nTake 1000 random samples, each sample having 10 people, from the population of adult males in the Netherlands, now calculate the mean of each sample, now do a histogram of the means, you\'ll get a normal curve.\n\nIf you just do a graph of each person\'s height, then no, you may not get a normal distribution, but you aren\'t doing a graph of their height. You\'re doing a graph of the mean of each sample, and since each sample has different people each time, the mean will be different each time. And since it\'s very unlikely your sample will have 10 short people or 10 tall people, you will get a graph of means that looks like a normal curve.\n\nBut its a normal curve of the means of the sample heights, not the heights themselves.\n\nOccasionally you will get a sample of 10 short people. Occasionally you will get a sample of 10 tall people. But that will be very rare and so those occurrences will appear at each end of the curve.\n\n"you seem to be suggesting that all distributions are normal, "\n\nI have no idea how get that from what I wrote "So, non-random samples = samples with uniform height = same means = no curve."\n\nI say right there there is no curve. Obviously if everyone is the same height then no matter how many samples you take the mean will always be the same. So there is no variance. No standard deviation. No normal curve.\n\nBut if there is variance in height, then a graph of the means of the samples will give you a normal curve.

you might try looking at \n\nhttp://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/percentiles.html \n\n\nand read the part \n\n"The first step is to compute the rank (R) of the 25th percentile. This is done using the following formula:\nR = P/100 x (N + 1)\n\nwhere P is the desired percentile (25 in this case) and N is the number of numbers (8 in this case). ..."

Dear Rajhansa and all, I did it. According to me I did it properly. I used excel for it. But it seems that I did some mistake. I will find that out today evening and will post on this link. Thanks for valuable support and suggestions.

Can we apply this test if group sizes are different?  How about comparison of 3 or more groups (of equal size)?

I am doing MSc in Cognitive Science.

I totally agree !!

Definition of SD = average distance from MEAN;\ntherefore if you use median/mode, it might still be a useful value but you will have to call it something else. Hope this helps...

Hi Kristin,\n\nI really appreciate this opportunity, I volunteered in pathology research and i want to continue my career in it. I had some difficulty with statistics, I believe this course will add a lot to me. \n\nThank you and your team for this unique opportunity, your presentations are simple and clear and I am starting to feel comfortable with everything.\n\nRana



Because mean only represents a point, it does not indicate how wide the data is.\nFor example, consider these two data:\nA:  1 2 3 => mean = 2, observations are centralized.\nB:  -50 2 54 => mean = 2, the spread is wide.

Good Example



It seems to be interesting.  I will try the R homeworks when i will finish with the lectures!

I agree , the question needs to be reworded. It is misleading and does not help answer the question.



I could be wrong, but I think the study participants are a sample.

Which  homework ?

It is different because R is using a different method of calculating the 1st and 3rd quartiles.  If you compute these "by hand", then you will get the correct answer in the quiz.\n\nBy hand, I mean first find the median of the data.  Then find the median of the lower half of the data set and the upper half of the data set.  Then use those values as your 25th and 75th percentiles.

It totally depends on how one calculates the quantiles. To get the results as in the quiz, you need `IQR(x, type=2)`

Indeed they are there. We have height and weight normograms made out for example for growth in children and curves and percentiles described for each particular age.This is used extensively in pediatrics.

s no explicit math formula for calculating the median, so it



Use the CC (Close captioning) button in the lower right-hand corner of the control bar.

We had the same discussion about age, since it is reported as a positive integer and not in decimals of seconds (which even then would be discrete - the representation of continuous variables of necessity is discrete if only due to imprecise measurement)\n\nNote that they treat heads/tails as a continuous variable to calculate mean/median, surely that is more discrete than RR

This R process is taking some time. Would you like to cancel it?

This is a good point.  I agree that this could use some clarification.  While it seems reasonable to assume that rounding would be appropriate, clarification would be helpful.

Yes, we mean for you to round to one decimal place, not simply truncate.\nActually, we\'ve built some "tolerance" into the answers, so it should accept both answers. But in general please round.

There are tolerances built into the answers, so in general it should accept a range of answers, including more precise answers. \nHowever, since we may not have anticipated every possible rounding iteration, your best chance of avoiding being marked wrong is to follow the instructions.

It is like percent.  The standard in writing reports is to state the result in cases per 100 person-years.  This helps to eliminate confusion when you read multiple reports.

The due date for Unit 1 is next Tuesday, 6/18.

You only need to complete one unit per week, but you are welcome to work as far ahead as you would like.

Module 6 of Unit 1 has no quiz.

If you go to the Progress tab you can get a global view if you scroll down.

An odds can be calculated from any percent value--so this would include prevalences and cumulative risks but not incidence rates.

The question was not phrased properly, i guess. The skewness is not connected with the relationship between the mean and median: a distribution with negative skew can have the mean greater than or less than the median, and likewise for positive skew.\n\n"Always" is wrong: take for example the data {1,1,2,2,3} which has a mean of 1.8, a median of 2 and a positive skewness.\n\nBut more typically, negative skewness is associated with some extreme values below the median and fewer or less extreme values affecting the mean. These will typically push down both the skewness and the mean.\n\ncorrect me if i am wrong :)

Hello All,\n\nI am wondering about the best approach to starting with the data for the first few questions from the Week 1 homework.\n\nIs there a tool that will reverse the frequency distribution so it will show as individual data lines OR should I manually expand out the data OR should I be able to somehow use the data as is in the frequency groups?\n\nSorry if this is a newbie question, but I am just not sure of the best way to prepare this data for analysis.

Nothing in Quiz #2 question denotes that the values should be considered as continuous but not ordinal (categorical). Wording in the question (hours/night, not duration/night) and notation of time on the histogram (natural numbers, no fractions) allow interpreting data as categorical.\nSo, two answers can be considered correct, depending on which prospective you apply.

I just posted about the same and then saw your comment. The quiz lacks clarity. Did some of the students actually answer, "I sleep 6.3 hours per night"?\nOn the other hand, what\'s the purpose of such histogram? Does information that interval is between 6.5 and 7.4(9) hours really carry more knowledge than it\'s 7 hours (which, mathematically speaking, is equivalent to any value between 6.5 and 7.4(9) being rounded to an integer).

Hello,\nI was just wondering if we can get a transferred transcript to our undergraduate schools?

Thanks! Noticed it a little bit after posting the message.

The use of histogram itself implies continuous variable; values are allocated into bins or intervals (I believe that was mentioned in video).  While most folks would likely report their sleep to nearest hour (e.g., "6" as opposed to "5 hrs, 47 min" per night), the bin width was pretty clear at 1.  Hence, values given could have been, for example, 5.50-6.49 for the "6" bin.\n\nIt may have helped if unit also included a preliminary review of real number limits.\n\nI do agree that several of the quiz questions and/or response options could have been better worded.

m using Chrome on Windows and both EdX and Stanford work like a charm.\nSo try Chrome or as mentioned above Firefox and see if that solves the problem :)\n\nIf not, you can come back here and we can see if we can find a solution.

You do have to keep a skeptical eye. Years ago, we had a "data analyst" entering and doing analysis runs for us.  In one data set, the mean and variance for one site for IQ-type scores for students was way off.  I asked for a listing of the data file.  Sure enough, one case had a listed value of 461.  When I asked if she had seen that, she said, "I thought it looked funny."  But, of course, she ran all the analyses anyway.  Leon Kamin published a work pointing out that Cyril Burt\'s life-long study of identical twins for heritability of intelligence was immediately suspect if you looked at the results.  Decade after decade, Burt\'s correlations (as new cases were added to his aggregate data set) were exactly the same, to 2-3 digits. As Kamin put it, "It\'s far more likely that the sun won\'t rise tomorrow [than to see such an event with real data]."

1. Yes. Most stat texts have tables of (exact) critical values for various combinations of group size, up to about 20 or 25 per group.  \n2. Yes. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks is the extension.  (Look under "k-samples" tests in SPSS nonparametric, or R (deducer shell, Analysis)

I agree as well!  This is just what I needed as a refresher - excellent teaching!

Thank you for that clarification.

I strongly disagree with the answer to question 2 in the quiz. A favorite fruit would imply an order (you can actually order from your most favorite fruit to your least favorite fruit). The question deals with nominal categories. So, I think the answer is wrong.

s go back to the example in the video, with the age data for 8 people. If I wanted to calculate the standard deviation of age only for people in the sample, I would have 8 in the denominator. If, however, I want to extrapolate from these 8 people to a much larger population, I would have 8-1=7 in the denominator.\n\nMost medical studies will use 'n-1

Thanks for the helpful comments!

ve seen the Deducer (R) tutorial. I've never used it before. \n\nI can't understand how can I put the data from the homework on the software. Should I write two rows on Microsoft Excel (R) and import?\n\nHow can I calculate the mean, the standard deviation, the median and the the interquartile range in Deducer (R)?\n\nAre there any suggestions for easier software to do the exercises? (I know they won

I believe that the question regards all the fruits in the "favorite fruit" category to have equal weight, so they cannot be ordered from least favorite to most favorite, since they are all "favorites". For example, if you were doing a survey asking 100 people to write down their favorite fruit, you would have 100 entries, and they cannot be categorized, thus making them nominal.



I need some clarifications on the question.\n\nDoes "n=60" mean that the group of healthy adults contains data from 60 adults while only six records are listed in the table as a sample?\n\nAre the numbers in the left column just sequence numbers?\n\nThanks in advance.

Hi, Tiago\nYou will find these answers in the next video.\nRegards

s my guess as to what

Since Deducer was not available on Linux and it seems not to be updated frequently, I went with RStudio. But no matter what, from the little I had had the chance to learn, you could either have you data created in Excel, SPSS, ... and saved in CSV format and then read it in "R", read.csv("path to file", header=T) if it has a header and header=F if it didn\'t.\nOr you could use the "c" function in "R" or use some of the data editors in RStudio or probably in Deducer for that.\nBut as of now, I think I will use a spreadsheet program and then save it in CSV format for importation.\n\nAs for the usual descriptive statistics, when you have your data read in "R", it has all sort of functions to help you with that. One thing that I have found to be very helpful is a package called "psych" which when loaded, provides powerful tools. summary(your_data) gives you the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and the max all at the same time.\n\nI think "R" is really a very useful tool to learn and hopefully we get a wiki for it up and running while we study for this course.\n\nHope this helps,\n--Mostafa

t necessarily predicated on any common sense, rather on the ability of the analysing party to project self doubt and double-check against reality.\n\nThis is why I'm a tad skeptical about advice to \x93use common sense\x94 \x97 we are more likely, having received it, to revert to our cognitive biases and reject actually useful pertinent data. Again, what is used in the example, isn't common sense, it's basic arithmetic, and if the advice was \x93double-check your findings against impossibilities and by means of simpler, more base techniques\x94 I wouldn



Tried the course on Windows (Chrome) and Linux (Chromium) and no problem whatsoever. Of course the site might not be slow-internet friendly but I cannot verify it.\nThe courseware used here is one of the best, I have seen a few and even though there are always places for improvement, as of now, this is a very friendly site for self-study, IMHO.

There are a total of 60 people in the study. There were not 6 records in the study. The first row of the table means that 10 people had outcome = 11. You add the frequency to get the total number in the study.

m all for the skeptical eye, my concern is that some students may misappropriate the abovementioned advice and discard relevant data going simply by \x93common sense\x94. It's a highly unstable fuzzy kind of logic to use for any study.\n\nBy the way, good example with the analyst, but see that what you used there wasn't common sense, rather previous knowledge of the possible range for IQ-like tests. It's the same as if I say I hit 700 on a dartboard in one throw \x97 I

**(1)** One option which I think it would be of value to users is the possibility of jotting down notes while watching the videos under the video frame or by its sides. I can always take notes in another editor, on paper, ... but now that everything is online and accessible from everywhere, it would be nice to have my personal notes to be the same.\nThanks,\n--Mostafa\n\nPS: I might come back and add a few more items here as the course progresses.

I am confident that there is a way for it but since I have just started using "R", I was wondering if there was an easy way to enter the outcomes in "R" with their respective frequencies and make "R" to take them into account when it calculates the statistics.\nThank you,\n--Mostafa

Split the data in half. Then take the middle value from each split. Subtract. It should be positive, as you have $x--y=x+y$.\n\nOr go read the response at\n\nhttps://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine/discussion/forum/db52b4f1dfc845c8a304f378599651b8/threads/51ba29989ce05b160000003e

The histogram tells you. Histograms are for continuous, bar charts for categorical. You can tell the difference as bar charts (should) have the bars separated, whereas histograms the bars have no separation.

m pretty new to statistics and my knowledge is limited.  Statistics scares me!!  \n\nWhen I went to the homework, I felt so...lost!

Firefox works perfect for me.

Dear GhaziAlotaibi,\n\nThe skewness of the data is indeed related to mean and median positions in a frequency histogram. Because the mean is more susceptible to outliers, it will "move" closer to them, while the median will not.\nDid that help?

Once data is entered, use the table function for a summary or hist function for a histogram.\nIf you want to learn more, type ?table or ?hist in the command line and you will be linked to the description of that function.\n\ndat<-c(rep(0,10),rep(1,12))\n\ntable(dat)\n\nhist(dat)



I see. I just saw the "rep" command in one of the tutorial videos in "R". this would certainly take care of the frequencies but I hope that there is a more automatic way of doing this. As per the homework question, if one column has the outcomes and the next one the frequencies, would it be possible to take those variables and enter it into a function and let the function to take care of doing the "rep". Something like this.\nThanks for the suggestion and as I said, I have barely started using "R" and I could use all the help that I could get. For the time being, I am following lynda.com module on "R" which seems to be a nice introduction.\n\nCheers,\n\n--Mostafa

Thanks MathPositive. I have to learn more about table. I have only seen a few examples so far but the "rep" seems to be very useful.\n\nCheers,\n\n--Mostafa



Unit 3, optional module 1 works fine, but there is no link to download the mp4.

So is it safe to assume that if the data does not follow a standard distribution then we can go the Mann-Whitney test? Or is there some sort of pre-test that can be done to determine which test is best? thanks.

No, not if you are logged in. I opened another browser to find it.

The video works, but there is no link to download the MP4.

Hi, the way I did it is this: \n1. rank the numbers highest to lowest. \n2. take .75 (75%) of 10 (n=10) gives 2.5 \n3. take .25 (25%) of 10 (n=10) gives 7.5 \n4. Q3 (75%) number 2.5 is between 3 and 0 based on the ranking.  So take average, equal 1.5 \n5. for the Q1 (25%) is 7.5 which is average of -11 and -14 (which is -12.5)\n6.  IQR = Q3 - Q1 so 1.5 - (-12.5) = 14 \n;-)

Is it possible to have the explanation to the answer for the Quiz displayed after we have select the check button? The answer to the quiz is not always obvious. With explanation, we would be able to understand the materials better since the quiz is an example to demonstrate what we just learned in the module. For example, it was not very obvious why the answer to quiz 1 in Module 3 is 10%. Thanks. Daphne

Hello All,\nWhere I can find Quiz ?

I am new to "R" but from what I have seen, if you save your Excel data in CSV format, then you could easily read it in "R" with read.csv command.



Thanks MathPositive for the feedback. It would probably make not much of sense to seek out easier way to do this in "R" for this course but I will look for one when I get more fluent in "R" or try to concoct something from the basic commands.

Hi All, What are the two buttons below home work? It says check and Save .\nWhat concerns me is ,the text next to it "used 0 of 1 submission". So which one should I click to submit(once I am done with the home work). and which one I can use to pause the home work then finish it next day?



Typically .5 or more gets round up\nex. 7.49 = 7 and 7.5 = 8

In the video, the prevalence calculation at the end of the video shows that 9/894 is .9%.  I think this should be 1.0067% or (to 1 dp) 1.0%.  Where did .9% come from?



Yes. You are right but when you say "my favorite", it implies that you have to choose from a bunch of element, a particular one. That particular one has a quality that makes it "favorite"or "special". In that sense, I think, an implied order (ordinal) may be found.

Click Save to save your answer - this **doesn\'t** submit the answer for marking. You can go away, think some more, come back and your answers will still be there.\n\nWhen you are ready to submit for grading, click on Check or Final Check (depending on how it is set up). The "used 0 of 1 submission" means that you haven\'t submitted yet. Some problems might allow more than one submission, though haven\'t seen any yet.\n\nWhen you click on Check, that\'s it. You can\'t enter any more answers, or change any. So be careful. Make sure you have answered all questions before Checking.

Hello. I wanted to ask about recommended readings for Probabilities. \nI have found the class material very useful, but having a broader scope on the topic would be great for me. Is there anything, like the Weekly optional readings, on probabilities that I could read?\nThanks!

If you are asking about this weeks homework Yes.

I know how to find the median in Excel, but only after expanding the dataset (ie one value, one cell)- is there a function that will expand the dataset? Or, is there a way to find the median with the grouped data as it is given to us? thx, pjl

I am certainly interested in that as well. I  have been searching all over to find a way to expand the provided data (without much success except for manually expanding the data).  I have also been told in a previous post that you do not have to expand the data to get the answers.  If that is the case, can someone please point to how I could find the formula for that?\n\nThanks

I have done it. Why ?

Thanks!



Actually you do not need to expand the data set. Use cumulative sums to find where the 25th , 50th and 75th percentile lie in. As an example if I have 21 tosses and I have 9 heads and 11 tails in a row then automatically my cusum for tails is 9 (and heads and tails is 21) so my 25th percentile must be 0, my 50th percentile (median) must be 1 and my 75th percentile   must be 1. Now imagine I have more choices and cumulate the scores in ascending order.  Hope this helps.

if you do it by the 3rd definition here \n\nhttp://onlinestatbook.com/2/introduction/percentiles.html , you get \n\n25th percentile = -13.25\n\n75th percentile =  0.75\n\n0.75 - -13.25 = 14\n\nyou could also try it the way I explained here \n\nhttps://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine/discussion/forum/db52b4f1dfc845c8a304f378599651b8/threads/51ba29989ce05b160000003e

Hi Everyone,\n\nIn the answers to the Homework should we round the answers to the given decimal or rather just give the answer to the given decimal?\n\nThank you,\nThomas

Ok, fixed now. Please have fun with the new wiki!

I am trying to do question 3 in Homework 2 and have a question about rate ratios.  I teach math and in math we always teach students to save all rounding until the end.  If I compute the incidence rates (and keep all decimals in my calculator display) and then divide and only round at the end, I get a different answer (correct to 1 dp) than if I round each answer to 1 dp first and then divide.  I know which procedure (the first) is the most mathematically correct but I am not sure which procedure I am expected to follow in this course and the issue seems to be glossed over in the videos.  In Unit 2, Module 4 part 1, the video shows a calculation (at about 6:37) in which 7.3/1.7=4.2 but actually if you do 7.3/1.7, it is 4.29 (or 4.3 correct to 1 dp).  This has added to my confusion as to the procedure to follow in this course. It will make a difference as to the correctness of my homework.

I cannot get your point.\n"Frequency per minute" seems to be the unit of "PR in breaths".\n\nHow can I add "the frequency" per minute to get the total number of the people?

Dear Professor Kristin\n\n    Thanking You\n\nRegards\nELA07



m facing the same problem as you, and although I'd like to get more information about the procedure we're supposed to follow, I think here you're supposed to use the rounded value to calculate the rate ratio.\nWhat makes me think of that is that you're supposed to round your answer to 1dp. Actually, the answer I find (if correct) if I calculate the ratio by keeping all decimals and then round to 1dp, my answer would be x.0 , which seems strange (as they would probably have wanted you to round to the nearest whole number then...). If I calculate with the rounded values I find x.9, which looks more coherent with the 1dp rounding-instruction.\n\nIf anybody has a better idea, please tell, I



I have the same exact numbers (obviously).  One gives x.0 and the other x.9.  I also have not checked my answers yet because I want to know what the convention for the course is and the videos are not consistent on this point.



Hi again,\n\nbut if nominal is just another name for categorical, then why do you say that "Age>=75 y" is a binary variable? Could not be also nominal? In the answer both appear as options.\n\nThanks.\n\nMat\xedas

> Thanks. It seems that I have got it. It is "PR in breaths per minute" not "Frequency per minute", right"\n\nCorrect. The first column is "Outcome (RR in breaths per minute)"\n\nThe second column is "Frequency" - so how many subjects had that particular value for RR. When you add the frequencies you get 60, which is the sample size.

Dear Prof.Kristin,\n\nThanks for such a wonderful course.The videos are really excellent.\nThe only difficulty I seem to be facing is the problem of rounding off in the homework answers.I feel a slightly wider range of answers should be accepted.\n\nWarm regards

it might still be a useful value' part is concerned. Both mean and SD of a list of entries reflect each and every value in the list . Mean is a measure of location & SD a measure of spread for every single entry and have very useful mathematical properties. No matter what the list and distribution is for all positive lists ,together two can give wonderful predictions/bounds as far as distribution of data is concerned (Markov's & Chebychev's inequalities) . And in case the distribution is normal then duo gives much more sharper results. Which is not true for median & proposed corresponding measure of spread. Both mean & median are measure of central tendency in their own way but the mean & the SD carry and are sensitive to each & every entry in the list. **Median is beautiful in it's own way but let

There are formal tests of normality. In this video however we concluded that the data are not normally distributed by looking at the histograms.

This is exactly the problem I mentioned before.In another Edx course we were allowed to have more than 4 decimal places accuracy  for eg(ie if you have 2 decimal places asked we were not penalized for giving a more accurate answer.

The same rule applies. If I have 20 "1"s and I now the mean I will find the deviation from each of these "1"s isn\'t it. Remember frequency just means that I have that many repeat observations of the same quantity

I can not download the module 3, part 2 and module 4 part 2. How can I download them?

Could we have an unread posts  button in the Discussion board. It is indeed difficult to go through discussions  searching for unread posts  as sometimes we find a response to a discussion (sometimes by a course teacher) after repeated hitting of "load more" and there is a higher chance of missing such conversations especially those by the course teachers etc.\n\nIt will be like using "is:unread" in Gmail to see all unread posts,

Discussion around 10:00 of video ...  0.4% is about 4 times 0.1%.  But 0.73% is also about 4 times 0.17%.  Some of the difference in perception depends on how many decimal places are presented and how many we focus on (e.g. if someone looking at 0.17 "sees" 0.1 or mentally rounds up to 0.2; and if they mentally look at absolute difference or fold difference).  I\'m sure you\'ll get to this in module 4.

Unit 1, module 5 , part 1 of 1st quiz question: Calculate the standard deviation of the following data points (round to the nearest whole number):\n\n+4, +3, 0, -3, -4, -5, -11, -14, -15, -300 ; the right answer in mcq options is arrived at by using factor 1/n . If we use 1/(n-1) instead, the answer we get is about 5 more than one provided in quiz option, that is marked correct.

All the answers have a "tolerance" built around them, so it should accept a range of answers including more precise answers. For example, if the answer we are looking for is 0.2, it may actually accept a range such as 0.1 to 0.3. So it should not matter exactly how you round or how many decimal places you enter. Hope that helps!

I think you have to calculate different statistics using the given values (statistics) without the actual data, and then determine the statistics type.



James,\n\nBe careful... where you mention average above, you are really referring to standard deviation.

If you are not able to complete the entire homework at one time, use the "Save" button; it will let the computer remember the all the answers you have entered till that point. This way, when you start working on the remaining problems, the answers you have "saved" will show up on your homework. You can also change the "saved" answers if you want.\n\nWhen you have completed all the problems, use the "Final Check" button; it will submit your answers to the autograder and that will mark each answer as correct or wrong. Do not use the "Final Check" button till you are ready to submit the homework for scoring correct/wrong. You cannot change any answers after you use the "Final Check" button.

You should round your answer to the expected decimal position. For example, if your answer is "1.4848", and you want to submit as 1 decimal place, you should submit "1.5".

Generally, since histogram bars represent *ranges* of values (rather than specific values, you cannot determine the exact mean or median from the histogram.  The mean can be approximated by creating a frequency table from the graph, but that table might not contain the true exact data values.  You might be able to approximate the median in a similar fashion, as well as, determine whether the mean is greater than, less than or roughly equal to the median.  In the module, we are *given* the mean and median displayed with the histograms that are shown.

To simplify, use the frequency as number of times a value appears. For example, there are 10 people with a reading of 11, and 9 people with a reading of 12, so when you make the list of readings, you can write it as: 11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11, 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9. So in the end you will get a list of 60 numbers, but each number is repeated several times. \nThen you can use the formulae you know to calculate median, mean, etc.

To find mean and standard deviation, one way is to multiply the value of the variable or the deviation (squared) with the frequency before summing it up. It is the same as adding the value of the variable a given number of times.

Actually, the quiz answer is correct using 1/n-1 for the calculation.  It does result in 5 more than using 1/n as you state.  But, if you use 1/n, your result should be 5 less than the correct answer shown in the quiz.  Try checking your math or interpretation again.

s question, but I see a number of posts asking similar questions, so I posted here as a general aid...\n\nHere's how to calculate mean, standard deviation and IQR from a frequency table (referencing homework 1)\n\nI do all of this in Excel by the way...\n\nCalculate the **mean** using the frequency table given by multiplying each outcome value (11, 12, etc.) by the number of times it occurs (frequency value).  You will end up with six products representing total breaths for each of the six breath outcomes.  For example, the outcome of 11 breaths occurs 10 times.  That

yeah, it is a totally weird discussion board.\n\nI can sort by date and NOT see any new posts.

Hey, my cat uses pawerpoint, too!

they should change "Final Check" to "Grade my work" or "Grade my answers"

Yes, it really is a great course!  But, the discussion board could use some enhancements.  For example, what happens if I "follow" a post?  Shouldn\'t I get some sort of email letting me know of a new reply?  Also, I posted on some possible enhancements a day or so ago.  I agree that sorting and searching functions need improvement and some additional options.

Hi,\n\nHow can I download this video. In fact all part 2 videos of few modules have this problem. Plz help!!

How do I calculate IQR for frequency distribution (and for binary variable)?



the downloads are NOT split into 2 parts\n\ndownloading the first video downloads everything

See my post on how to find the mean, standard deviation and IQR from a frequency table

See my post on how to calculate the mean, standard deviation and IQR from a frequency table.

is it 320? or 420%?

I often use Excel to check my work when using new programs (such as Stata or R) to make sure I am programming correctly.

1st thing is to sort your data from the lowest to the highest. For a binary case, it would look like something like this:\n\n0000001111\n\nFor a frequency given outcome, s.th. like this:\n\n12 12 12 14 14 17 20 20 20 20 20 22 22\n\nThen look for 25%, 50%, 75% cut-off and that is 25% of your total data count not their values.\nFor the freq. example above, there is a total of 13 data points, 25% of that would be: 25% * 13 = 3.25 Now the question is to take 12 or 14 as the cutoff for the first quartile. If we used 12 (the 3rd one), then it would certainly be wrong since there are not enough data below that to account for 25% of data (there are only 2 and we needed 3.25) so the next choice will be 14 (the first one). Same thing for 75% cutoff --> \n\n75% * 13  = 9.75\nSo the cutoff for 3rd quartile will be 20, the 4th one and consequently the IQR will be:\n\nIQR= 20-14 = 6\n\nHope this helps.

I wave them in front of my college-age kids...

That is correct for all sections EXCEPT the the optional Math Review... it has a download video link, but it is missing the download link for slides.

The way I read it, the INCREASE is 320% (.42-.10=.32, which is 320% more than .10).  But, the RATIO is 420% (4.2).

See my earlier post (today) on how to calculate the mean, standard deviation and IQR from a frequency table.

I see. Thanks for the help.

Hello everyone,\n\nI am excited as everyone else here to follow this course. I am also very grateful to Stanford and in particular Dr. Sainani to have provided us with such refined set of lectures and practices. So far, I have been enjoying every seconds of it.\n\nI teach engineering classes at Miami University but recently have decided to do some research with regard to education systems and for that matter, I should be able to use statistics and do study design as efficiently as possible and I am confident that this practical course would be of great help.\n\nGood luck to everyone,\n\n--Mostafa

Many folks have asked about the availability of "Part 2" videos.  This response is true for all modules with multiple parts.\n\nWhen you click the link that says "Download video here", you are actually downloading ALL video parts for that module.  On screen, you view them separately via different clicks on the upper scroll bar (Part 1, Part 2, etc.).  On download, all parts of the module\'s video are included in the file you download (via the link that is underneath the Part 1 video for any given module).\n\nI hope this helps!

Since the sort and search functionality on the the Discussion Forum is somewhat limited, would it be possible for the course TAs to add an FAQs section to the top menu that includes canned responses to all the recurring questions?  This would allow students to search there for some of the general site-related answers.  Some examples that come to mind are: availability of power point slides, availability of part 2 modules, other web resources for stats, and so on.  If the TAs do some summary stats on the categories of postings, they may find some low-hanging fruit that can be posted on an FAQ link, then respond to applicable forum questions with "refer to FAQs".\n\nJust a suggestion that might lighten the forum traffic and TA response load...

See most recent post on this... "Part 2 videos (and all other parts..."



These are discussed very briefly in the the last few minutes of module 5, part 2 video (accessed via scroll bar link above part 1 video).  Starting at about the 8:30 mark in part 2 video (or slide 94 in the downloadable slides), professor talks about percentiles and IQR using box plots.  If using the complete downloaded video file, it starts at about the 19:25 mark.

This was very, very helpful.  I will certainly be keeping these notes for future problems dealing with frequency tables.

Look for scroll bar above part 1 video to access part 2.

Great question. I look forward to hearing the answer.

I guess the important learning I would get out of this course is how to analyze the data we are given.  If we are told that a given variable is normally distributed and asked to calculate certain parameters accordingly, then we do the math accordingly (regardless of whether the variable is normally distributed in real life or not).  This is a statistics class, not a clinical class.\n\nI fear that this post is becoming a rant...

To be honest my experience with Chrome on edX is that the first video in each section always autoplays. I just click play and pause immediately and that sorts it. A little tedious as I downloaded all the videos in one hit at my local library as my internet access is a little flaky at home.

Look under "progress", you should be able to see all.

The histogram just can\'t tell you how many students are sleeping exactly 7 hours per night, it can only tell you how many fall within the specified range for a given "bin".\n"7.0 hours" implies a continuous variable (where 7 might not) and also implies high accuracy (which the histogram does not).

If you read the question carefully, you will notice that it asks you to calculate the unadjusted risk ratio for one particular subgroup only (>=5kg),and not both subgroups.\n\nRaj

This excerpt from the wiki page on Prevalence answers your question:\n\n> In epidemiology, the prevalence or prevalence proportion is the proportion of a population found to have a condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use). It is arrived at by comparing the number of people found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and is usually expressed as a fraction, as a percentage or as the number of cases per 10,000 or 100,000 people. "Point prevalence" is the proportion of a population that has the condition at a specific point in time. "Period prevalence" is the proportion of a population that has the condition at some time during a given period ("12-month prevalence", etc.), and includes people who already have the condition at the start of the study period as well as those who acquire it during that period.

yhh thanks! My carelessness.

Perhaps I am doing this problem wrong or interpreting the wording incorrectly, but if I am doing this problem correctly, I do not get a whole number percent and the question gives no advice about the number of decimal places with which to answer. I am assuming that the overall 10 year survival rate is 0.2 and that the overall 5 year survival rate is 0.6 and that we are being asked for the conditional probability of surviving 10 years given that you survived for 5 years. \nPlease clarify if I have interpreted correctly.  If so, please clarify the correct number of decimal places.\nThank you.

Thanks JS Vidya. I got the point. The suggestion of James is also good.

Hi I\'m using a Mac. \nAfter I installed R as said on the website, two icons appeared in the applications folder,  R and R64. When opened, they are same: R console. Then I input the commands to install deducer. But still couldn\'t see data viewer. I found "deducer" under package manager, but couldn\'t load it. There is no default next to "deducer" as mentioned on the website. Anyone can help?

I find myself referring back to the lectures from each unit when I do the homework. I would like to know if there is a way to download the powerpoint slides to keep for future references. Or will the course materials remain available to us at all time even after the course is over?\nThanks.

Hello everyone...\n\nThis is a great course and I am really excited to start this. I may be a little bit slow as research and data is a relatively new thing for me.\n\nI am having problem with the videos; sound quality is not very good and I cannot hear all the dialog clearly. And the slides shown in videos are a bit blurred. Some data on slides in not readable.\n\nOnce again, many thanks for such a wonderful course.\n\nRegards.

It is the prevalence of the outcome in the reference group,the placebo group here.

How do I write out the sensitivity of age 55+ as a marker for ankle fracture in terms of conditional probabilities (or which of two is given)?

Focus on the last part of the video on diagnostic testing where you draw a 2*2 table with 100 people and fill the boxes with the numbers using the given probabilities.once you get those numbers you can easily calculate the PPV,NPV,sensitivity and specificity and then see which statement matches with your answer.

From the Course Info tab:\n\n>If you are not interested in receiving a Statement of Accomplishment, it is fine for you to audit the course and review only the materials that interest you. **The course materials will remain available after the course ends**, so you can also go through the course at a later date or slower pace (if you are not trying to receive a Statement of Accomplishment). We hope that this course can address a wide range of learning goals; and we expect that some students will just be browsing/auditing.

Thanks a million!

what is the difference between cumulative risk vs the prevalence rate?

Another way is to create a vector of the data in R for example.\n\nExample:\n\nx: 10 12 13\nFreq: 12 14 10\n\nIn R, all you need to do is:\n\nv = c(rep(10,12), rep(12,14), rep(13,10))  #v is a vector, rep: replicate\n\nmean.v = mean(v), median.v = median(v), sd.v = sd(v), IQR.v = IQR(v) \n\nVoila! It is that sample.

A prevalence rate is like a snapshot; there is no time element to it, so cases may be recently diagnosed or decades-old. It answers the question, What percentage of people **are** sick at this point in time? (Edit: slight adjustment for period prevalence - see next question and great answer - but the main point is that you\'re counting all cases, whether new or old.)\n\nCumulative risk looks at the number of **new** cases that occur over a period of time that must be specified, whether implicitly (the duration of the study referred to) or explicitly (for instance, "the cumulative risk was 5% for 1995-2000 but rose to 7% for 1995-2005"). It basically answers the question, What percentage of people have **become** sick over this particular period?\n\n(Of course all these statistics can refer to populations that do not consist of human beings developing diseases. It\'s just easier to use these examples.)

Thanks ghromis.

That\'s been my experience with the "divide by n or (n-1)" debate. When my students compare two data sets of , say, 20 and 30 people, they will find the s.d. by dividing by 20 and 30 respectively. They are interested in comparing the two data sets, typically how one class has performed relative to another. So in this case, it makes sense to divide by n.

They are available  in the teaser section of each week

But do I have to leave out the zeros for the answer to be marked correctly?

Is it standard practice in the US to leave out the zero before the decimal? \nWe have quiz questions with "Please enter your answer to two decimal places (e.g., xx.xx)."\nbut also with "Please enter your value to two decimal places (e.g., .xx).\nSo do I have to omit the zero in the second?\n\nI read that the answer system is flexible but it would be well mean if including a zero loses you marks. \n\n(OK, I know it sounds pedantic but why do you leave the zero out anyway? If we are writing stuff down by hand why leave it out when someone could come along and add another digit to it? - I guess they could do that anyway, even if it were another number! Anyways, it mystifies me)

I set up my problems in Excel to avoid this issue altogether.  When I do that, I see that using the exact-digit mean yields the same 2-digit standard deviation as when I forcibly use the single-digit mean.  Excel maintains the calculation integrity throughout all the subsequent calculations.\n\nAside from that, you should probably try to save your calculated mean to at least 3 or 4 digits since the standard deviation requires 2-digit precision.  You also need to maintain that same precision throughout ALL your calculations to get to the standard deviation (subtracting, squaring, multiplying, adding & square root).\n\nHope this helps!

I did Unit 1 homework while having constant distraction. When I finished the last one and before submission, I mistakenly clicked on "final check" which I thought was for me to do one more check.

Incidence explained as "20 new cases per 1000 men per year" is surely a rate. But the cumulative risk as "1% new cases over two years" - even though it\'s a percentage obviously the "two years" part means it\'s again a rate, so I\'m confused.\n\nIs it like speed and acceleration? Cumulative risk tells how is the disease spreading overall, while incidence tells the speedup of the spread - is that correct?\n\nIt\'s also hard to google out the terms - the only [other definition][1] I was able to find seems to equate "cumulative risk" and "cumulative incidence" but here it starts getting even more confusing! :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://practice.sph.umich.edu/micphp/epicentral/cumulative_incidence.php

Funny thing is that 169.49 when asked to be rounded to a whole number in one of the homeworks is rounded to 169 (In the answer).

There are so many methods of rounding .\n\nfor eg\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding\n\nI find this a bit confusing and unfortunately you can be wrong despite a right answer !

One of the problem in premature rounding is errors compound. Unfortunately when setting the autograder if the margin is kept narrow you can be perfectly right and have a wrong answer  if the problem was done with premature rounding or vice versa(You can be wrong  - in both cases the steps may be correct. In some Edx courses they allow you to enter answers with greater precision than the given decimal places (The Edx Autograder can be set up for this ie be accurate to at least 2 decimal places - so you can answer upto 4 decimals and still be marked correct)) and this can remove the fear of being penalized for being more "precise". In fact I automatically used that method  in the first HW  thinking it will be the same as in the other Edx platforms and realized that that method is not being used :(

Using excel to solve question 1 and 2 is the quickest way, instead of wasting time to compute the data manually.

Hi, \nThe same thing happened to me - I clicked on "final check" b/c I thought it was just to assist me in checking before submission... If I had checked without clicking, I wouldn\'t have submitted with a mistake in it.

Yes, using excel is faster. \n\nBut in this week\'s optional reading paper, the author mentioned, "Manual data entry is often unavoidable and is an obvious source of error. Unfortunately,\nresearchers compound the problem by also altering the data\x97that is, fixing values or\ncalculating new variables\x97from within data-entry programs **such as Excel**"

Just my own thought -\n\nI assumed that the provided data is sufficiently exhaustive which would imply that the variables in contention should be binary. \n\nIn a medical study, we define the metrics and the given extract of metrics suggest that they are indeed binary.

On Unit 1 hw, I was doing the last problem and i thought i test it out and so i assumed clicking "final check" will check my answer before submitting, assuming it will not submit and it did and now i basically have a zero on my hw = what do i do?

I have added the links to all the slides sets to the course wiki.

s perspective!), and the delivery of the material is very engaging. Also, the various tips and the extra reading material add significantly to the value of the course.\n\nAnd now to the quibble: Would it be possible to increase the allowed homework submissions to 2, for example? I think this would be a life saver; it would allow us to catch silly arithmetic and/or rounding errors. Alternatively, maybe the platform could be reprogrammed to a slightly wider margin for rounding. We

I agree, David. You need to be able to figure these things out on your own - because only by doing do you really begin to understand.

Does any kind soul (or /and including the course engineers) know how to download the .srt files (for the captions) This way we can have the captions for the videos in offline mode. I tried to capture the .srt files using a YouTube caption downloader plugin in Firefox but it doesn\'t seem to work :( . If the course engineers could put up the .srt files on the wiki we could download them for offline use and would be of great help especially when we speed up videos for say revision (as the voices become chipmunkish when speeded up offline :) ). Also since many of us (who are non Americans) find the American accent difficult to follow at times - we have to replay a section repeatedly sometimes to understand what a particular word or phrase meant and also at times some word  is just unfamiliar wrt usage - for eg "N\'s" I was not sure if I had heard it right as that was a usage I was not familiar with and then finally understood that as "Numbers" ! This will sort out a lot of confusion related to such issues.

Why do we multiply the IQR by 1.5 and subtract/add from Q1/Q3 to find the whiskers in a box and whisker plot? I understand that we use it to identify outliers but is there a reason why we use 1.5? Or has it just been arbitrarily chosen by someone way-back-when?\n\nThanks :D

Thanks. Problem is you are terrified that you will get a wrong answer I just took a chance with one hoping I was correct  !

Thanks for pointing out that this one might be confusing. Race is certainly not a binary variable in general!  But they are treating race as a binary variable in the Table, because you are given only the information about white vs. non-white.

Just curious as to how many people are doing this course?  Does anybody know?

In Homework 1 Set 1 Question b should we use the exact value for the mean in our calculation of Standard Deviation (with as many decimal places as there are).  Or should we use the rounded value like you asked for in Question a?  Thank you.



Here is some sample data that I loaded into R and then made a histogram of the variable EF.pre. \n\n\' Data<- read.csv("EF.csv", header=T)\nnames(Data)\n[1] "EF.pre"  "EF.post"\n\nattach(Data)\n"#end of loading"\n\nhist(EF.pre)\'

yes very interesting point to learn form this course

Why is it so the quizzes can be tried and checked multiple times. Why not single submission enough as it carries 10% of weightage only





Dear prof. Sainani,\n\nVery good job. A good opportunity to refresh my knowldge. Wonderful course. \n\nThank you so much.\n\nKing regards,\n\n\nE.A

I think those quizzes are there to allow us to make mistakes and correct them so that we learn !!

Think of it that if I had 100 people followed for 1 year (or 50 people followed for 2 years)it (the event) would occur in 2.1 times.

This  has happened so often by so many people I think that it the blue label should be labelled as Final Submit" rather than "Final Check" !

If 2315 people are followed for one year, that equals 2315 person-years.  56 events per 2315 person-years = 56/2315 = 0.024 events per person-year.  To make the outcome more readable, the incidence rate gets multiplied by factors of 10 until there is at least one whole digit to the left of the decimal.  In this example, multiplying 0.024 events per person-year x 100 = 2.4 events per 100 person-years.\n\nSo, if there is a single, leading zero to the right of the decimal (0.0xyz events per person-year), then multiplying by 100 will you give x.yz events per 100 person-years.  If the incidence rate calculation yields two leading zeroes to the right of the decimal (such as in the first problem set of homework 2), then you must multiply by 1000 to get your first whole-number digit.  In that case, 0.00xyz events per person-year x 1000 = x.yz events per 1000 person years.\n\nHope this helps!





Found it. Thanks

I agree.  Final check is misleading. I did it myself but luckily everything was in the way I intended.

Why is rate difference preferred over risk difference? Is it because cumulative risk can be measured over a short time period and may be distorted?\nAdditionally does the precision of cumulative risk increase as length of time measured increases?

You can get to it by clicking the "Overview/Weekly Teaser" link for any of the units.  Scroll down below the opening video and you will see 3 links... the opening video download, the Unit slide download and the Quick Summary pdf download.

Marcin,\nYou are correct... there should be a "squared" indicator in the numerator since variance is the sum of the squared deviations divided by n-1.

Same! I really love math and statistics so I decided to take this for fun

You want to make sure you enter your answers before hitting final check.



You want to make sure you enter your answers before hitting final check.\n\nJust curious, why would you hit "Final Check" if you had not entered any answers?

I am a high school student and I just finished my sophomore year. So no medica background! I just love math!



This has affected soooo many people in this course.  Fortunately for me, the fate befell others and they posted on this forum before it affected me.  But, it appears that many folks have been misled by the wording of the homework buttons.\n\nSuggestion: Change "Final Check" to "Submit"; change "Save" to "Save Current Work" with a note that it is not yet being submitted, so you must come back and submit later.

The online link for this only runs a 3 min 28 sec long video, however downloading has a 25 min 14 sec video.



Agree, and, the downloadable video quality for the Unit 1 R solution is very poor (out of focus at laptop screen size; hard to read), so we have to rely on the online video which is truncated at 3:28.  Can this be fixed?

If you were taking off in an airplane, you do a Final Check Off before Take-Off, not during Take-Off...

Where is the R optional exercise for Unit 2?

Realizing there are a number of missing file and video links issues identified in different posts, I started a running list of some tech issues here in one spot for the HRP258 Statistics in Medicine staff to track/fix:\n\n1)\tMissing link for PowerPoint or pdf file download of \x93Math Review\x94 slides\n\n2)\tMissing link for mp4 video download of Unit 3 Optional Module 1, \x93Calculating Probabilities\x85\x94  ***FIXED 6/17 - Link is now active.***\n\n3)\tMissing link for mp4 video download of Unit 9, \x93Overview/Weekly Teaser\x94  ***FIXED 6/17 - Link is now active.***\n\n4)\tTruncated video for Unit 1, R exercise 1 (Optional), \x93Exercise 1 Video Solution\x94 \x96 the downloadable video is about 25 minutes, but the online video only lasts 3-1/2 minutes. ***FIXED - Online video now lasts 25+ minutes.***\n\n5)   MP4 download link for Unit 6, module 3 is not working.

How do we access the quiz?

As of right now, only Units 1, 7 & 8 have optional R exercises.

When you select a module for any of the units, you will see a scroll bar above the little video screen that opens up.  The scroll bar has links to access the different videos and quizzes for that module.

HelalHosny, your question is interesting. And, I think, the answer can be found in the corresponding definitions of \x94Variance\x94 and \x94Standard deviation\x94. \nVariance is: <b>The average of</b> the squared differences from the Mean.\n(\x94The average of\x85\x94 part is the reason why we divided by \x94n\x94 or \x94n-1\x94 and not by \x94n^2\x94 or \x94(n-1)^2\x94) \nStandard deviation is simply by definition: <b>The square root of the Variance</b>. \nS = sqrt(S^2) and therefore, we take also the square root of \x94n\x94 or \x94n-1\x94.\nI hope this helps.

I see, Thanks alot.

Got some problems with answers in questions 4, 10, 11. Although I answer correctly question number 1, it was not the exact number, so if you get it right and made the next calculation for Q4 answer gets wrong. Same for question 10 and 11, is confusing use different math terms from one homework to another. (decimals points - round to the nearest tenth). For advice u should use the same terms for the next of the course.\nThanks.

How do the negative numbers fit into the calculation of the mean? (sorry for the very basic question)

You can download it first on your pc with some other software e.g. Real player and enjoy the lecture



HelalHosny, the real question is "why do we square the difference between the mean and the individual data point"? \n\nhttp://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html \n\nand there\'s actually a very good reason to do so, and if you understand why  it\'s ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to square those, you\'ll also see that there\'s jsut no reason to square n

yeah, I suggested "Grade my answers" or "Grade my homework" instead of "Final Submit"

no, unfortunately this has bee ansnwerd already, no way to resubmit

I noticed on my weekly progress from the quiz section Unit 1 module 5 that there were 5 questions.  However I only saw 3, and I got one (of the 3) wrong.  So I never saw the other two questions before I pressed the check button.  It never occurred to me the "check answer" would be on every sheet (is it?) rather than at the end.  Can you help me out?  Resubmit maybe?  Thanks

Thank you James. I figured it out. I got confused when I had a negative mean and negative differences from the mean. Although, I understand the concept, my basic math skills are rusty.

Are you a staff member or student?

Two :-)

As James mentions, it is done the same way regardless.  For example, the mean of (-3, -2, -1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6) is calculated by adding all 8 numbers (total= -6 + 18 =12) and dividing by n: 12 / 8 = 1.5.

t seem to preclude all but one answer to question i, but the page won

Thanks much for the fast answer. I think the clue is what the question asks for "..the risk of hospitalization in single-pill users ..." and what the appropriate answer may sound like. In this case: "The risk of hospitalization in single-pill users versus three-or-more pill users is XX". When answered like this, we need the three-or-more pill group as reference.

This is not quite right--the thirteenth value (25th percentile) is 0, and the 75th percentile is 1.  IQR = 1-0 = 1.  Otherwise it looks correct.\n\nYou can calculate the IQR (or any other statistic) for binary variables exactly the same way you calculate them for any other data set; the only difference is that every number in the set will be either 0 or 1.

If you\'re not sure whether you submitted something, click the "progress" link (next to "discussion" and "wiki") and see if you have a score for it.

Pretend they are real data.  Which graphs make you say, "That looks wrong?"  Pick the one that doesn\'t.\n\nEdit: To answer your question directly: only one answer is considered correct.  If you choose either of the other two, it will be marked wrong.



My formula:\n\nsqrt([53(0-0.47)^2+47(1-0.47)^2] / 99)

Just like question E, you can find the answer to question G in the table.









Yes.

I\'ve given up on "really" understanding how the IQR is calculated.\n\nIt seems there are at least 9 different ways to calculate the 25th and 75th percentile.\n\nThe statistics package R let\'s you specify which of the 9 you want to use.\n\nhttp://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/quantile.html \n\nIt seems SAS does it one way, R does it a different way, Minitab and by SPSS do it a 3rd way.\n\nSo you may get a different answer depending which program you use !\n\nRight now I\'m just going to stick to he mathisfun way. I do not understand the math explanations in the R help at all.

This question is for TAs (or instructor). This quiz is a multiple choice and I got it right, but is it possible to give some explanations with calculations for the wrong answers as well? Thank you.

Try this:  Uninstall R, delete the old R directory, then re-install using the the Deducer/R/Java all-in-one installer that our video instructor used.  Then use the Deducer icon to start R and install the XLConnect package so you can import the data file.  Use the Package Manager to make sure Deducer, Deducer Extras, and XLConnect are set to start automatically.\nHope that helps.

Why we did not square the denominator ( N-1) when we calculate SD ? How does the equation still correct if we squared the nominator only ???!!!

I had the same problem.  I decided to just analyze them a few at a time instead of all at once.



I am not able to see videos at speeds other than 1.0. However, I am taking an EdX course and the faster speeds there work perfectly.

You can try reproducing the lecture calculations for risk, rate, etc. in R if you would like more practice. We should try putting examples of how to do this up on the wiki...

Me too. I was hoping for a perfect score since I did the homework carefully. I still made some mistakes in end. Anyway I guess the quizzes help to better the grade. 89% HW1

what confuse me and i can\'t understand is: she asked about the homework median, yet we went to the percentage and switch it to students no. and see where is the 50% of student rather seeing the 50% of hw on X axis and see how many student in that 50%. plus what she mentioned after, that the bar as a mass, 50% of that mass will be to the left while 50% will be to the right at 10h, where is if i "look" to the graph  will not be accurate because the mass on the right  is more than the one on the left at 10h. that makes me looking to X axis and try to get the median from there. how do you explain that ? and how do i not to fall in same confusion in the future ?

I really enjoyed this very interesting analysis of the lipstick "problem" :)\nI would like to point out only a minor inacurracy in the slides (and the explanation) around minute 14: The average exposure to lead through lipstick is about 0.1% of your PTDI, not 0.2% as it is stated in the slide and commentary.

I did not get the exact answer stated in the quiz.  Because the data set was an even number I used 1.5 for Q1 and -14.5 for Q3 and got a IQR of 16.  What did I do wrong?  Thanks.

I am not opposed to only one attempt on the HW, but I need feedback on answers.  As a mathematics teacher, I either provide my students with the answers to check their work or I give them feedback on their work so as to not make the same mistakes.\nI did not do as well on the last problem of the HW and still have questions.  Can I ask questions on HW here and get feedback from my peers?

I agree with sallysue.  All the quizzes are due before the end of the course.  Professor responded to another post confirming this.

Yes, the median is not affected by extreme values. What she is saying is that the percentile and median are not affected by extreme values.

Variance is the (sum total of all the squared differences between each data point and the mean) divided by the sample size minus 1.  It is essentially telling us the average squared distance from the mean.  We only square the differences to eliminate all the negatives when calculating total distance.\n\nStandard deviation is the square root of the variance (square root of the whole equation including both numerator and denominator).\n\nOther than that, if you want a derivation of the standard deviation equation, you might check some of the statistics sites or Google.

Thank you so much :)

and Excel might do it another way!

I had the same worry, but when I tapped on the tab "Progress" it says 100% for this quiz. I\'m assuming there is only one question.

I too was confused by the race variable, I thought about this before answering but  I could not find any indication as to wether it was white/non-white or not in the text. Anyway I guess at the end it wont make a difference for the grade, but maybe it can be clarified for future courses.\n\nGreat course btw, Thank you.

Hi,\nI too have a problem with submitting my home work 1. No progress when click on save or final check buttons. Could you please help?

The way I read it is that a ratio of 1 is equivalent to no difference in the outcomes. A ratio of 2 would indicate a doubling or 100% increase, and hence it follows 4.2 is 320% increase.\n\nWould be great if someone could clarify.

I agree that one attempt on the homework is not enough. I actually got confused by the meaning of the buttons "save" and "check". I thought the check button lets me check my answers before submitting them and I was not aware that this was the actual "submit" button. Therefore, I submitted the homework prematurely without intending to do so and I did not get the full score. \nCan we have one more attempt at least at this first assignment?

I second the suggestion of adding donwnloaded video quality improvement to the list.

*Why we did not square the denominator*\n\nSimply because that is not how Standard Deviation is defined.

If the ratio was 1 (null value) this would mean that there is no difference in the outcomes. A ratio of 2 would be 100% increase and hence 3.33 = 233% increase.

t see any quiz listed for the last lecture of Week 1.  Should there be one?\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to have a separate discussion forum for quizzes.  Though please _don't_ create a separate quiz discussion for each module.  I can't keep track of the nightmare of module discussion forums as it is!  It might be easier to have one forum per unit/week.

First, I note that our lectures didn\'t really show how to compute an interquartile range.  I used what one of my books calls the "method of medians" to get the correct answer for the interquartile range question on the quiz for Module 5.\n\nHowever, I also tried computing the interquartile range in R, using the handy IQR() function.  I got this result\n\n> unorderedRange = c (+4, +3, 0, -3, -4, -5, -11, -14, -15, -300)\n> \n> IQR (unorderedRange)\n[1] 12.5\n\nwhich is noticeably different from the correct answer.  I would like to understand why R is computing a different value from what we get using \'common sense.\'  (Sorting the data first didn\'t make any difference.)  Thanks for any clues you can provide.

Thanks a lot for your answer! It is good to know that I can delete my own posts.\nHowever, I decided to keep my post and not to upvote the other one, because the other poster seems to be rather confused by the nature of the rounding error, and that post, I think, would only confuse people.\nI did make the title of my post more descriptive though, just as you suggested.\nThanks again!

Spoiler alert, apologies if I should place this comment in a different forum, not yet familiar with the etiquette and operation of MOOCs:\n \nI feel that the quiz question I saw following this module is ambiguously approximate- since each bin is 4 bpm, and 92-96 and 96-100 represent about 53%, while the 84-88bpm bin alone has about 10%, so the sum is definitely above 10% and below 50, with where it falls depending on how you choose to subdivide that 88-92bpm bin. Perhaps replace the figure with a histogram using bins of 5bpm for easier estimation?

seven _m_

Spoiler alert again:\n\nA similar ambiguity in the module 3 second part quiz question: The middle bar of the histogram is labeled "7". Does that represent a continuous value or discrete value? If continuous, the hatch marks indicate that each bar represents a space from 6.5 to 7.5 (answer B), while a discrete value would suggest that >50% of students reported sleeping 7 hours (answer A)? Unfortunately, the histogram is not labeled for a definitive answer, and the histogram convention is clearly not strongly defined, as the professor remarks that her particular plotting software considers values from low<x<=high to be within a bin, while other software acts differently.

Hello, Why we say that range is between 0 to 40, if some student make 45 hours of homework. Thank you.

apparently there is no agreed upon way to calculate IQR\n\nthere are at least 9 ways of doing it \n\nR uses the IQR functon which uses the quantile function \n\nhttp://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/IQR.html\n\nhttp://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/quantile.html\n\nthe quantile function let\'s you specify which of the 9 ways you want to do \n\nR, Minitab and  SPSS and SAS each calculate it differently !\n\nIQR(x, na.rm = FALSE, type = 7) - this is R\'s default\n\nIQR(x, na.rm = FALSE, type = one of 9 numbers)\n\nI\'m not sure which calculation type is "correct"\n\nwolfram alpha gives the correct response for that particular one, \n\ndon\'t know if it will work for all \n\nhttp://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=IQR++-300%2C++-15%2C++-14%2C++-11%2C+++-5%2C+++-4%2C+++-3%2C++++0%2C++++3%2C++++4

Thanks for your comment, Kristin, and congratulations on making stats actually  fun and easy to listen to and to comprehend.\nOnly regarding the histograms, I am unfortunately  even more confused now after doing the homework for unit 1 last night, as the question e, set 1 shows histograms to visualize the breath frequency per minute, which I would consider a distinct variable, especially since the data set only reports full numbers rather than i.e.  10.57 breaths/min or similar.  So does that mean histograms can still be used for not continuous data or \x96 if breath frequency is continuous \x96 how can I recognize   if such a data set (with only full numbers)  is representing continuous or discrete data?\n\nAlso, like many  others I got confused with the homework having a final check and a submit button:  I was literally meaning to  go through all answers for a final check before submitting my answers and realized only after clicking  that  the final check button that this automatically submitted my  answers. Luckily I overlooked only one sub-question, so the damage isn\x92t too major for me. For a next course or so, I think   it\x92d help to have only  button, that actually submits the work as if there are 2 it kind of imply that they are not doing exactly the  same\x85.\n\nThanks again,\nCiwi\n\nPS: Is there a quiz for unit 1,   module 6?  In the course progress summary there is clearly a spot labeled quiz 6 but I cannot find any questions in the module\x85

"HOW TO USE DEDUCER" video clip teaches how to install Deducer and use it for a mock data spreadsheet. Somehow, the voice is really low in the tutorial and does not show where can get the mock data spreadsheet.

Hi everyone, tonight when i was doing my quiz on unit 1 module 5part 1, suddenly the class.stanford.edu was down. \nI dunno if it was only with me the problem or with everyone,but it was no problem at all because like 20 minutes after it was ok again, but a lil bit laggy...\nAlso another question there is the precourse survey and quiz that i already completed, now i see that i have to complete it again... my question is that ok? or i need to complete it again...\nCongrats for the course... i like it very much and i feel motivated to finish it at this point... hope that it doesnt get so complex in the next steps..

Forgive me for posting a question about the HW.\n\nSet 3, question g: What percent of participants in the placebo group have hypertension? \n\nData shows: 2409/3258 (73.9%)\n\nHowever total participants of placebo group is n=3281. \nLeads me to conclude that there is missing data on about 20 participants\n\nSlightly changes the answer if we consider total n to be 3281

The formula for calculating a confidence interval is:\n\n[lower bound, upper bound] = [mean - z*(standard deviation), mean + z*(standard deviation)]\n\nThe z-value you use depends on how "confident" you want to be that you captured the correct value in your interval. So, if you want to be more confident (eg. 99%), your z-value will be higher, and your confidence interval will be broader, than if you want to be less confident (eg. 95%)\n\nRaj



this is a nice explanation

I see your point, but the answer is much closer to 10% than it is to 50%!\n\nRaj

yeah, but if you consider n to be 3281 then what do you do with the 23 "extra" participants ?\n\ndo you conclude they do have hypertension 2432/3281 \n\nor do you conclude they do not have hypertension 2409/3281 \n\nthe only thing you can know for sure are the numbers you have, 2409/3258



Sleep in hours is considered a continuous variable for this question. By convention, distribution of continuous variables is represented by histograms, while that of discrete variables by bar charts.\n\nRaj

Any study that models categorical outcomes based on predictor variables can use logistic regression.\n\nRaj

When data is missing for a variable,the correction is to first exclude missing entries for the variable. Here they have already excluded those missing values. Do you mean to take those back?

You can only go on complete data. n=3281 only if you have 3281 responses. Unless you are able to impute the missing values.

Remember that the first homework assignment is due tomorrow (Tuesday, June 18) by noon Pacific Time

Will they give me the minimum marks?



Thank you Raj.\n\nby the way, then what does "cross sectional study cannot determine causal relationship" mean ?







Ahmm I guess the minimum mark is zero .... so probably. \nThese things happen unfortunately. In another course, I had calculated a series of (correct) values for an exercise but while selecting the answer in the choices, read values from my notes a line down from the one I should have entered ... after submitting I see a big X next to my answer! Fortunately I had only done it for the one value and not all. Do not do submissions when tired, distracted, hot & bothered etc. It really does need your full attention. \nI just finished checking a page proof, submitted it and up came the "Would you like to complete our survey on your publishing experience with us" .... Oh YES I would .... but what do I do in my haste? I click the "No Thanks" button (slaps head!)\nBetter luck next time.

re using n-1 since it

Because you used up one of your degrees of freedom in estimating the mean itself that you are using to do the SD (you have really only estimated the mean because it is not the *true* population value, just the value for a sample of that population).

s important to check your answers - make sure they actually make sense, and if you can do a calculation multiple ways and come up with the same answer, then you will be more confident that you're doing it correctly. The silly mistakes will really hurt you when it's an all-or-nothing answer and there

Hello everyone! Nice to meet you!\nMy name is Saskia Stein and I am living in Hamburg, Germany. I graduated with a PhD in Molecular Biology at Cornell last year and after returning to my home country am now searching for a job. \nAfter stumbling upon the thriving and developing field of MOOCs I am now using my spare time to refresh my skills in topics I never really got into depth with and also to pick up new skills, like for example programming, which I always had an interest in. \nI am really looking forward to this course and have been enjoying the first week of this class, as the last statistics course I took has been more than 10 years ago. During my thesis research my statistical applications were very narrowly focused and it is great to get the big picture of the field again and view everything with a very different standpoint from the one I had as an undergraduate student with no research experience (the situation when I took the last statistics class). \nThank you so much for offering this class Professor Sainani!

Think of a cross sectional study as sweeping a room at ne time and seeing the contents. If I see andt and peanuts  in what I sweeped I cannot say that the ants came after the peanuts  or were the ants there before the peanuts were dropped  so I cannot surmise which was the cause and effect.(Did the ants come after the peanuts  or not)

...five thousand six hundred and ninety nine...hello all from Manhattan!

I am a retired US Administrative Law Judge who decided disability cases. I believe I got an A in an undergrad statistics course (for psychology) about 35 years ago.  I have no idea what SAS is, and did well on Unit 1 homework with pencil and paper and the PC calculator...but think I may need to learn a statistics program and get a scientific calculator?

I just checked my progress, and quiz#6 shows 0, but there is no quiz attached to video #6. Where is the quiz???

Quizzes are numbered sequentially regardless of the unit they are in.  So, quizzes 1-5 are in unit 1, quizzes 6-10 are in unit 2, quizzes 11-16 are in unit 3, and so on.

This has been mentioned in several other posts already.  The quizzes account for 10% of your grade and you can try them multiple times for practice.  They are kept open until the last day of class (8/16).  However, the professor recommends attempting the quizzes for each unit as you progress through the course since they help prepare you for the homework which is due weekly.

Hi,\n\nHigher values (difference between measurement and the mean) when squared give higher contribution to the sum than lower values (as was explained that 1 when squared results in 1, whereas 5 squared gives 25). why would not we then take square root of individual differences before we sum them to reduce the effects outliers have on the s.d.?? why do we sum the terms before we take square root?

That is just the way the formula for standard deviation was defined decades ago.  It is a measure of dispersion and we want the standard deviation to be affected by  outliers to depict how much variation there is in the data.

Hi one of the questions in Q1 ask for which ones are treated as binary...\nIn the table all variables are treated in "percent" (continuous variable)... except placebo or not placebo (binary). \nIs there a misunderstanding on what it means "treated" ... this needs clarification for me.

Hi,\n\nwould it be possible to add optional exercises that involve R for all the 9 Units? Currently there are available only for 3 Units (Unit 1, 7 & 8).\n\nBest\nGianni

think of binary as \n\nYes or No\n\nTrue or False\n\nthe variables are listed in the left side column \n\nplacebo and not placebo are not variables, they are groups that have variables \n\nthis is binary \n\nQ: Are you right handed ?\nA: Yes or No\n\nI can ask that question to both groups, but it is only ONE variable because it is only one question, one thing that changes(varies) from person to person

Hello,\nSorry but for me Question Set 1 was not clear? Frequency could be related to breathing too.

Thanks a lot Professor!!! I was in great dilemma over this.

This is the closest posting I have found to discuss this important point. Question set 2 a, b, d all pertain to handling a binary data set. The toss of a coin data set cannot be expressed as a mean. A better central tendency would be mode. Further, standard deviations only apply to comparisons from the mean, which is not a good tool in this case. Also, for binary data, how can one express an IRQ? This seems to be a better statistic for quantitative data only. If the point of set 2 was to run calculations, I think a better exercise is to use truly quantitative data.\nI also have commentary regarding question set 3 a. The choices were limited and since age is not continuous in this example (but rather, discrete), categorical is a better choice. On the other hand, the choice "ordinal" was not provided. Truly, age is a categorical in the ordinal subset.

it says "breaths per minute", so that column is your frequency of breathing \n\n11 per minute, 12 per minute and so on\n\nbut the Frequency column refers to the number of people who had 11 breaths per minute

James, I posted the following in another thread, but I think it is useful here.\n\n Question set 2 a, b, d all pertain to handling a binary data set. The toss of a coin data set cannot be expressed as a mean. A better central tendency would be mode. Further, standard deviations only apply to comparisons from the mean, which is not a good tool in this case. Also, for binary data, how can one express an IRQ? This seems to be a better statistic for quantitative data only. If the point of set 2 was to run calculations, I think a better exercise is to use truly quantitative data. I also have commentary regarding question set 3 a. The choices were limited and since age is not continuous in this example (but rather, discrete), categorical is a better choice. On the other hand, the choice "ordinal" was not provided. Truly, age is a categorical in the ordinal subset.

Example Left Skewed Data: 1,2,10,11,12 Mean = 7.2, Median = 10, therefore Mean < Median.\n\nAdd one more data point: 1,2,3,10,11,12 Mean = 6.5, Median = 6.5\nHere Mean = Median.\n\nTherefore for a left skewed data set, Mean <= Median.\nThis was inaccurate in one of the quizzes.

The question I have is whether the question was properly stated. The question asked for the percent of Placebos with hypertension. \n\nIt seems we only have an estimate of the true population percent. Taking an extreme example, what if n= 3281 as before, but for hypertension the only data available show 6/10 (60%)? Is this still the percent of participants in the placebo group with hypertension?\n\nWhere does one draw the line?

Hi Professor,\n\nIn several of your modules, you discuss various statistical tests in your PowerPoint slides.  What you show appears to be excerpts from an Excel file with many rows of information, but you only show those pertaining to that discussion in the slides.\n\nCan you post the complete file for us to download so we have it in one place?  Perhaps in the Getting Started section?



This is now fixed! You may need to refresh your browser.

how is B the correct answer and not A? answer B states "More than half of the students slept between 6.5 and 7.5 hours per night" but according to the histogram, exactly 50% of the students slept between the 6.5 mark (start of the middle bar) and 7.5 mark (end of the middle bar), whereas answer A states "More than half of the students slept 7.0 hours per night," which according to the histogram is true, because from the 7 mark (the exact middle of the middle bar) and on towards the right, those percentages added up are >50% of the students. Am I wrong or missing something about this? I would be annoyed if this were a homework question because there would be no chance to correct it, but since it\'s a quiz question I don\'t really mind, I just want to know if I\'m doing this wrong.

Please, the professor goes a little bit fast, can you change the velocity to have 0.75x speed in the video?, 0.5x speed is very slow, in this moment I must stop and stop the video in order to follow and catch everything, thanks

I am also confused at this question

In the optional R exercise 1, the video solution is not complete, the video lasts like 3 minutes

The histogram bar that goes from 6.5 to 7.5 hours includes all students who slept any period of time from 6.5 to 7.5 hours.  It could even mean that everyone in that bar slept 6.5 hours.  So, from the histogram, there is no way to tell how many students in that bar slept 6.5, 6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.5 hours, or any points in between 6.5 and 7.5 hours.  All we know is that just over 50% slept some period of time between 6.5 and 7.5 hours.

Lawyers... Jeez!

Thanks... we posted that as #4 on our running list of missing/broken links here.\n\nhttps://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine/discussion/forum/i4x-SampleUniversity-HRP258-course-Introduction_to_Medical_Statistics/threads/51bdfa55bf600b0a00000025



You must already know what percentages are, so here are links to percentiles.\n\nhttp://statistics.about.com/od/Descriptive-Statistics/a/What-Is-A-Percentile.htm\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank



works now!

Chrome work, but IE 10 does not. Quite surprised that QA did not test.

Why is it not possible to download this?

For g, the exact percentage is given in the table (no need to over-complicate it).\n\nFor h, binary variables are those that have a "Yes" or "No" answer.\nExamples:\nFemale Sex, \nAge>75y, \nWhite Race, \nHypertension\n\nAnother way to look at it is... Of the 13 variables given in the table, how many are continuous data variables?  Those are the ones with means or medians.  All the rest are binary and have proportions listed.

I have the same question, but I think the answer is in slide 59, where we calculated the rate ratio for GI events and got a result of 0.46 (since it is less than 1.0, it reflects a protective effect).\nIn the heart attack case (slide 63), the rate ratio is 4.2 (greater than 1.0, so the effect is not protective).\nIf we subtract 1.0-4.2=-3.2 which, in percentage would be a 320% increase of risk. \nI wander if this is the correct interpretation.

How can the formula for SD be correct? the calculation is correct, but it does not follow the formula which indicates summation of (xi-X), and not summation of n(xi-X). can anyone explain how the calculation followed the formula?

It is the same.

Correction: Where I put "a 320% increase of risk" I meant "a 320% rate increase".



Actually think that the percent in the table is only an estimate of the percent of the placebo population with hypertension since it was calculate with less than the full population.

hi! the speech is not written  in this video..it helps us to take notes ..thx to take into consideration this remark

Left skewed distribution is one where observations are not distributed symmetrically around the center but continue farther to the left than to the right of the center. So due to non-symmetric spread while median stays at center, extreme leftward values drag mean lower than median as extreme values have dominant influence on mean but none on median. The list 1,2,3,10,11,12 is not at all skewed but perfectly symmetric.



I am not clear the degrees of freedom, a bibliographic reference?

The numerator for variance is the summation of ***all*** squared deviations.  That means if you have several points the same distance from the mean, each distance is squared and added to the summation.\n\nIf you have this frequency table:\n\nx, Frequency\n\n10, 5\n\n12, 6\n\nThe mean is ((5 x 10) + (6 x 12)) / (5 + 6)\n\n= (50 + 72) / 11 = 122 / 11 = 11.091\n\nDenominator of Variance is n - 1 = (5 + 6) - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n\nNumerator of Variance is summation of all squared distances from mean\n\n= (((10 - 11.091)^2) x 5) + (((12 - 11.091)^2) x 6)\n\n= (((-1.091)^2) x 5) + (((0.91)^2) x 6)\n\n= (1.19 x 5) + (0.826 x 6) = 5.95 + 4.96 = 10.909\n\nDivide 10.909 by n - 1 to get Variance = 10.909 / 10 = 1.091\n\nTake the square root of the Variance to get standard deviation\n\nStd Dev = sqrt(1.091) = 1.044\n\nSo, you can use this general approach when you have a frequency table.  I suggest setting it up in Excel and double-checking with a calculator and paper.

The link is right under the video and works fine.\n\nhttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-edx/MedStats/Video240p/Unit+1+Module+5.mp4

It is a general question so you should be able to apply it to any example you may take. The distribution in my example is not symmetric. It has symmetrical subgroups but as a whole the data is left-skewed.

The distribution in my example is not symmetric. It has two symmetrical subgroups but as a whole the data is left-skewed.

Thanks Doc for your comments. \n\nFor h, although we have proportions listed for the "categorical" variables, they may not be necessarily binary. My question was concerning missing values in some of these characteristics as we see in the dataset(yes,no and missing) and not in the table(figure shown). \n\nSo I guess not thinking much about the dataset and also the missing values, then we need to consider them as binary variables. In which case, I got these answers wrong in the homework.



m a high school student and live in Virginia though I go to school in DC. I

drArvind is correct... 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12 is perfectly symmetrical (with respect to the mean) even though the data set does have two subgroups.  Each subgroup is perfectly equidistant and mirror-imaged from the mean, so no skewness exists.

so stranged, I can not submit my homework for week1st unit?

m glitching at the explanation for how IQR is calculated from the difference between Q3 and Q1 in the Box and Whisker plot. For example: Unit 1 Homework, IQR for Respiratory Rates of Healthy Adults data and Coin Toss Data. How do I see where the IQR occurs, when I don't even know how to get 25%, 50% and 75% for the data range. Do I list the data (i.e., RRs and Frequencies) find the median for the 50% and then do the same for the two opposite quartiles or is there a formula I missed in the modules? I

The deadline was noon PDT, 21 minutes ago.  Your above post says "13 minutes ago", so it looks as though you may have missed the deadline by about 8 minutes.

These links might help you:\n\nhttp://www.statisticshowto.com/articles/how-to-find-an-interquartile-range-in-statistics/\n\nhttp://classroom.synonym.com/calculate-interquartile-range-2744.html\n\nKeep in mind that that if you have an odd number of data points, the median is simply the middle value.  If you have an even number of data points, the median is the AVERAGE of the middle pair of data points.\n\nFor example, if your data set is\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nwe have an odd number of samples, so the middle value, 3, is the median.\n\nIf our sample is\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nwe have an even number of samples, so we want to average the middle pair of numbers, in this case (3, 4).  The average of 3 and 4 is\n\n(3 + 4)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 = the median\n\nIt makes sense that the median will be right in the middle of the sample data; i.e., halfway between 3 and 4.

Greets, if you are referring to the third section from the first homework assignment, it states "***white** race*", it\'s a binary variable as there are only 2 options, being or not being ***white***.





make sure you run Rgui.exe not R.exe in the bini386 or binx64 directory.

Thanks, James, but I was not looking for the R-exercise dataset.  In some later lectures, the professor discusses several types of hypothesis tests.  We see a snippet in each section of what appears to be a spreadsheet showing an explanation for the hypothesis test for that section.  I would like to be able to download the whole spreadsheet that has all the test types and explanations.

Yes, mean and standard deviation can be calculated for the binary data sets, I am just not sure how really useful they are until you start talking about proportions.



Thank you Doc.

Great example... Thanks for sharing!

I thought it would be interesting to analyze these report statistics like the lead in lipstick example.  http://www.honeycolony.com/article/dangerously-high-pesticide-levels-in-brand-name-tea/

mmm, I haven\'t looked at the later exercises yet, but the R data actually is a "spreadhseet", a csv file actually that will open in Excel\n\nit contains all the homework, LoveMath, drinks, exercise data she talked about in the Unit 1 videos\n\nit contains a bunch of columns, so maybe the later lecture stuff is in there too

Idem, was impossible submit the homework, I had problems with my Internet service......\n\nI now????.....

I just went back and checked... not what I was looking for.  The first meaningful slide of Unit 7 Overview/Weekly Teaser shows what I am talking about.

my internet connection failure at least two hours and now is impossible submit the homework.....\n\nAnd now?...\n\nWhat about technical problems...there are some door open???

There could well have been 15 races in the study. But, as the table shows, the percentage of white in both groups was around 95%. So the numbers in the other race groups might have been too low for sensible analysis. So they were collapsed into one group.

The homework submission deadline was noon, PDT, or 3pm, EDT (about 3 hours ago).

I have the same observation here. This happens at the 1:21 time mark of the module video. Please clarify.

Dear Staff,\n\n  I have missed Unit 1 homework deadline just now which I thought it was due at 7pm.I would like to know if I could still get a certificate from this course if I submit everything homework assignments ahead of time from now on? \n\nThanks,\nJen

I am also having a problem with submission and I thought it was until 12pm!... that was what was written...

t there any way they can verify that i was trying at that time but this online class had loading error?\n\nYou had a week. When relying on internet communication you have to allow for last minute problems. So don

The first homework deadline was almost 5 hours ago. As mentioned in the emails and on the course info page, the deadline was at noon (12pm). We have not been told that this has changed, so noon was the cutoff time.\n\nIf you are seeing 19:00, that is UTC



This is a new course on a new system. There are going to be issues. Dummy spitting after the first hiccup? Give the course time. The instructions we have been given are quite clear in when everything is due. We should be notified of any alterations.

Okay I hope the use the right calculator when they check the homework values

it was until 19:00 UTC time, that is probably not 19:00 your local time\n\nyou had to do the conversion



It`s a pitty, I thought it was 19 hs in stanford.

I did not see the save button so I can not submit.\n\nNgozi

jenL - They will toss out the lowest homework, if that helps.

Hi sallysue - No glitch... 19:00 UTC is same as 3pm EDT or noon PDT.

Well Lmar, they do toss out the lowest homework.  So, if you get the rest done in time, you should be able to get your certificate.

I can not understand which kind of calculators are using in the course. If I divide 56/2315, in mine old one, I obtain 0.02419 and not 0.021. What is happening?

Thank you very much for your reply.\n\nBut I am still puzzled by the use of logistic regession in cross sectional study.\n\nAllow me to put it in this way.\n\na) Logistic regression is used to show causal relationship\n\nb) cross sectional study cannot determine causal relationship\n\nc) But we still use logistic regression in cross sectional study\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.\n\nThank you very much.

use Chrome of FireFox\n\nuse the Save button to save your work and NOT grade it \n\nuse the Final Check button to submit your work and grade it

56/2315 = 0.024 not 0.021 \n121/2316 =0.052 not 0.045



do I use the neg number minus the negative mean and then square that?

Agreed - also PowerPoint slides in a few places or Unit 2.  Kind of messes up the whole problem.

Looking for distance between each point and mean, then squaring it.\n\nExample if value = -3 and mean =-8.  If using (-3) - (-8), then distance = 5.   If using (-8) - (-3), then distance = -5.  Either way is fine because once you square the result, they yield the same squared distance (25).

12:00 PM is NOON, 12:00 AM is midnight.  Assignments are due at noon PDT.

If I divide 56/2315 I obtain 0.02419 and not 0.021 as is showing on the module two video. Also there is mistake in the second proportion; if I divide 121/2316 the result is 0.052 and not 0.045. What happens?

Check your directory. Could you show the error message?

t bother to check if the match on the slides was correct.  I

Yes - the math on those slides is incorrect.  Unfortunately, I used those numbers in another post for the 100 person-years example to illustrate the principle, and I just assumed that the math on the slides was correct.  You caught this on my other post as well.

d like to check my understanding of this week



For people who can not submit the homework, is there a possibility to check or contrast our answers? Please let us now. Thanks.

How many of you experience interruptions in video stream of lessons? Solution?

In unit 1, module 5, quiz 2, first question about IQR I get this:\nsummary(quizz)\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  -300.00  -13.25   -4.50  -34.50  -0.75    4.00\nThen IQR would be: 12.5\nit would be better 13 against 14?

Some of the online videos are cut off (or were, as of last night).  Try downloading it instead using the link underneath the video.



Logistic regression is not used only to determine causality.It is the regression technique to use when you have a binary outcome (or categorical outcomes)as the sudden jump in the curve (for eg from 0 to 1 allows you to deal with binary outcomes in an equation form.\n\nAlso technically logistic regression is not strictly used to determine causality but the Odds. You then use causality tests but they are difficult to apply and at the end of the day causality still involves using biological/physical plausibility etc etc etc.The numbers spit out dont exactly mean causality but suggest a possibility of causality.The teachers may correct me if I am wrong.

The value of p that you think is right is what you set up before your experiment.(Based on what alpha and beta errors you want to set up for the experiment)

Hope this helps\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation

I managed to download the ;srt files for Unit 3 (the caption files) but I tried to upload them to the wiki page but it does not allow me  an option to upload these files as they would be helpful to others when trying to view videos offline. Any way that these can be posted as and when I manage to capture them ? I may do week 4 and 5 this week.

I think you need to have a scientific calculator. After some time some of the problems are impossible to manually calculate and also, in todays world the use of these has allowed statistics to better integrate real world problems into study and thus work.Otherwise, most problems had to be rigged to allow easier "manual calculation"

Are you the same person as our course director ? :)

But still.. race is not a binary variable... I understand that the only data that is shown to us is White race, but we dont know if the paper included asians, blacks or indians.\n\nAs well Female or Male. I understand that logic tells me that it is 0 or 1, but still the concept of it self it should be nominal.

You should be able to calculate the odds ratio, refer to the unit videos for the formula!\n\nRaj

You can represent ratios as both fractions and percentages. To convert fractions to percentages, multiply by 100. For example, 2/3 = 66%\n\nRaj

Think of this case like this: Incidence rate is measured in events per person per year (or events per 100 persons per year or events per 1000 persons per year). So if I had 2.4 events per 100 persons per year, if I look at only one year, I should get 2.4 events per 100 people.\n\nRaj

For me noon just sounds to be unusual as a deadline for an online course homework given any time zone. As the students are from all over the world, from very different timezones, I thought it is a common sense to have midnight as a deadline... end of the day in a given timezone.

Somehow I have trouble with Deducer. \nI am working on a Mac with OS X 10.8.4\nOriginally I had installed another version of R, but as it apparently does not work with Deducer I deleted it and installed R from the link on the Deducer webpage. I than followed the instructions but could not load the Excel file for the homework due to some error with the XLConnectJar, which I posted in a different forum post. Someone answered to my plea, but when I oppened JGR this time to try out the different file, Deducer did not load properly. The little JGR window which just blinks up when starting was empty and the window with the icons for the data import is completely blank aswell. None of the menubar links in the JGR window work and I can not enter anything in the window either. I tried to close JGR and the menu to choose to save before exit pops up, but clicking on either button does not work. I finally choose to force quit it. I tried to deinstall everything and reinstall R and Deducer but I still am having the same problems. \nI am wondering if I do have the problems because I updated my Mac yesterday as it had told me that updates were available. \nDoes any one have any tips for me how to get JGR/Deducer to work again?\nThanks a lot in advance!

In Unit1 Module4 in the example of binary value coded as 0 or 1, it is stated that the median of that data set is 1.  I cannot see how this is conceptually possible or makes any sense.  I did consider whether perhaps the median should be 0.999999*, but then less than half of the data set (ie 20 students in the example given) would be below the median.  \n\nLikewise, asserting that the median is 1, would either mean that more than half of your data set (30 students) or the whole data set (50 students) is below this value -- depending on how you look at it (East or West).  Setting the "median" at 1.16666* (one sixth of the way into the set of 30 students who played sports) does not work either as no student was coded to a value of greater than 1. \n\nThe conclusion must be that it does not make sense to try and find a "median" for binary data which has been arbitrarily coded into two adjacent numbers and calculation of the median cannot be applied in this case. \n\nThe only way I can see it (possibly) working is if binary data was coded to be either "0" and "100" .... or two other arbitrary numbers far apart. [To be exact, far apart enough to equal or exceed the number of data subjects.]\n\nAny comments?

@LRHN: Nice link.\n\n@Praveen: The criterion to judge whether a study is observational or experimental is simply to see who makes the decision regarding who gets the "treatment" under study. If it is the researcher who decides, then it is an experiment (which can have various forms, of course, since the decision on who gets the treatment can be made in several ways). If, on the other hand, the researcher has no influence on who gets the treatment, and this decision is made by the subjects themeselves for example, or by their physician, then this is an observational study.\n\nSo, regarding your example, a knee surgery is of course an "intervention" in the clinical sense of the word, but for your study to be "interventional", it must be *you* who somehow decide whether a patient gets the surgery. If it is their orthopedic surgeon who makes the decision, and you just check what happens next, then your study is observational.\n\nTo reiterate: interventional = the researcher has control (i.e., makes the decision; whether a participant goes along with it is a different story!)

In Unit 7, prof. Sainani explains how we should use relative risk for 2x2 tables and chi square for RxC tables. I am very confused, because I see chi square been used all the times (in medical literature) to obtain p-values out of 2x2 tables. On the contrary, prof. Sainani derives the p value of the 2x2 table thanks to the its z distribution. This p value is of course different than the one I would obtain if I used chi quare on this 2x2 table. Therefore, my question is: how should I present my data if I have a 2x2 table, please? \nThank you very much in advance, \nPaolo

Dear all,\n\nMay the HIV transmission calculation (Unit 3 - module2) be thought as a permutation with replacement repeated 100 times?\nIn other words, if the transmission occurs in the first act, it does not matter if occurs again in the second, third or 100th act; if it occurs in the second act, it does not matter if occurs again in the third, fourth or 100th act and so on... Or is it a combination?\n\nThanks!

In this question in the relevant quiz\n\n*In a particular randomized trial with n=150, the goal is to randomize half of the participants to treatment and half to control. A researcher flips a coin for each participant and puts the person in the treatment group if heads comes up and the control group if tails comes up. If 69 end up in the treatment group and 81 in the control group, how far off is this from expected?*\n\nThe exact answer (to two decimal places)is SD =6.12. 69 and 81 are 6 difference is Z= +/- =0.98 which is less than 1 .In the answer , it is rounded of to 6 and the answer given as correct is 1 standard deviation whereas it is actually less than 1 SD (o.98 SD  is less than 1 SD). This is actually an ambiguous choice where rounding gives one answer whereas the more precise answer gives a different one.

What are you to do when you want to appropriately factor in confounders in common occurring events?

Are you supposed to report both numbers and then make a note on why they are different? \n\nIf this is the case, then why even factor in confounders with log reg in common occurrences in the first place? Or do we just not care about confounders when calculating risk in common occurrences as the results will be misleading?\n\nThanks

Hi Alberto,thanks for your answer. I agree, more samples could help. But these are gene expression data from animals, so I am very limited by the group size.

So I guess the sign test would not be appropriate.

Hello,\nI just have a question with regards to the HIV example (Unit 3, Module 2):\nIf we were to calculate the probaility of conrtacting HIV (at least once) after 100 unprotected sexual intercourse, then that probablility would be equal to the sum of P(HIV once) + P(HIV twice) + P(HIV thrice) + ... + P(HIV 100 times). The probability of getting HIV only once "P(HIV once)" is (1/500)*100 which equals 20%. So, if we would also account for P(HIV twice) + P(HIV three times) + P(HIV four times) + ... then the total probability "P(at least once) should be more than 20%. How come the answer is 18%?!\nThanks,

Please read the question carefully.One asks for absolute difference in ***rates*** and the other absolute difference in ***risks***. They are both different things.

which program is used to analyze the data?

Can you explain what the difference is?

which program is used to analyze the data?

Please go through the module describing incidence and prevalence. The difference is explained there.(Module 3 Unit 1)

Thanks for the explanation.\nThanks

It was clearly stated in the lecture that there is probably no perfect Gaussian curve based on sample data.

go to that video\n\nclick on "Show Discussions" below the video \n\nread the discssions

the question says reciprocal to difference in disease prevalence not rate difference hence the statement is incorrect.

There is a bit of a discrepancy regarding the definition of NNH. \n\nIn the video lecture, NNH is calculated as the inverse of rate difference. However in the 3rd optional reading, "communicating risks clearly" on page 2, it says that "the number needed to treat(or harm) is equal to the inverse of the absolute risk difference". \n\nRisk and rate are different so which one is it?

Would be great if you could include the Saturday 17-Aug in the exam window for people (like me) who would struggle to take it during the working week. Thanks!

Some examples deal with models where data mimic a normal distribution to illustrate a point. No need to hyperventilate.

It would be nice generally if before homework was graded, the student was told "You have left questions X,Y and Z blank. Are you sure that you want to submit your homework?" No one wants to submit their homework without answering all the questions, and this would prevent these kinds of accidents.

s's answer. 281.5 / 7 = 40.2143; sqrt(40.2143)=6.3415 (6.3). I hope this is useful. Feel free to have a look at my Excel worksheet if you haven

"Number needed to treat" is the inverse of an absolute rate difference. As the absolute rate difference is measured in events per person, NNT is measured in persons per event. For example, if I knew the rate difference between two treatments in a particular case to be 1% (or 1 event per 100 people), I know that I will have to treat 100 (=1/0.01) people on average to see 1 less event.\n\nRaj

The techies are looking into creating some instructional videos.

re right! We noted the errors already, and we



Suppose you had 5 people in a study, who had been followed for the study for 1, 1, 0.5, 3 and 5 years respectively, person-years of follow up would be 10.5 (=1+1+0.5+3+5). Think of it as the average number of years followed multiplied by the number of people followed (hence the units are person-years). Person-years is popular as a unit because observing one person for 50 years or 50 people for 1 year each would give you the same number of data points, so you should treat both cases as equivalent.\n\nRaj

I see what you mean but I think it is appropriate usage.  "Next" doesn\'t necessarily imply future, it can simply mean that there is a sequence.  If you simply say "in this module," you don\'t connote that it is occurring in a sequence of modules.  And "in the next module" is inappropriate if you are actually at the start of/within the module to which you are referring.\n\nI could be wrong.  Good question.

O.K., thanks

P(seroconversion) = P(atleast 1 transmission) = P(1 transmission) + P(2 transmissions) + ... + P(100 transmissions)\n\nNote that each of the terms on the right hand side are "combinations". For example, the first term calculates the probability of exactly 1 transmission, which could happen in any of the 100 acts. Thus, the total probability is actually the sum of the probabilities of 100 combinations.\n\nRaj

Is there any method to locate all posts by myself, or by any other author?

I can not undrestand how they calculate and get 320, anybody can explain it

As I my undrestanding Rate ratio is 0.46 it means ratio of incident rate by using vioxx is 46 %and rate ratio is less than 1 (0.46) we have to interpret protective effect or reduce risk which is( 100-46=54) 54%

None that I can find.  However, if you click the triangle in the upper right of your own posts or any others you want to track, they are flagged as "follow".  Then, click the "Show All Discussion" menu to the left and select "Following".  It will show all posts you have flagged to follow.

Agree with Parastoo. When we calculate rate ratio we wanna figure out the rate of occurrence of an event (p)*(in this case: GI events)*. So, if we want to find out the protective effect (q), we have to subtract the rate of occurrence form 1 (1-p).

Click on your name in red above your post, and you will find your posts. Same thing for anyone else.

Dear James, with respect, I still think your explanation is flawed. Your analogy depends too closely on a literal physical geography. The binary data has been turned into an ARITHMETIC number on a linear scale, not a piece of physical geography, so it should be handled as a NUMBER not as a geographical position. \n\nIf the Median is defined as an arithmetic number where half the data values are greater than that number and half the data values (also numbers) are lesser than that number, then trying to find the Median still doesn\'t make sense.  ...How can one say that some data points with a value of 1 are "higher" or somehow "greater than" the supposed "Median" value of 1, while other data values of 1 are somehow lesser than exactly 1 ?

s probably better to use the rate than risk if you have it so you can be more precise about what you

I believe that you are right Teretriana. The risk ratio is 4.2. It means that the risk of having heart attack (the event or p) in patients using Vioxx is 4.2 times more than those used Naproxen. Now, if we want to calculate the ratio of not having the event (no heart attack or q) it would be 1-p: 1-4.2= -3.2 or -320%. The minus means that this is not a protective effect.

I found it discuss below.



The right answer is (42/46) / (13/45), which is 3.161, and which rounds to 3.2 and not 3.1.  My answer was 3.2 but it was rejected. Why? Thanks for your comments.

I asked some grammar experts and they said that using "next " is redundant. My US friends told me that they also have heard it being used but consider it as wrong usage :)

Just to clarify:\n- 56/2315 = 0.024 (not 0.021 as depicted in the slide) \n- 121/2316 = 0.052 (not 0.045 as depicted in the slide)\nTherefore, the incidence for the Vioxx group is 2.4 events per 100 person-years, and the incidence in the Naproxen group is 5.2 events per 100 person-years.





When the risk ratio of A to B is 3.33 it means that the risk of having the outcome in condition A is 3.33 times higher than having it in condition B. So, if we want to know how protective condition B is it would be 1-3.33= -2.33 or -233%. Minus means that it does not decrease and is not protective, it increases the prevalence of outcome.

I calculated the risk ratio, .4/.1 = 4. I then calculated the odds ratio, .4/99.6 over .1/99.9 = approx. 4. My question, why is the odds ratio = 6 the correct answer? What am I doing wrong?

Sorry if this has already been asked and answered.  I was not able to successfully submit the Unit 1 Homework by the deadline and was wondering if the answers will be/are posted somewhere.

Yes. As commented on many times in other posts below this one.

They are already available. Click on Show Answer on the Homework page.

"In this next module" is said at the start of the video. So to say "in the next module" would refer to the next video. \n\n"In this next module", to me, is just saying this is a module that follows another. But my grammar is more than bad.

Odds for treated = 40/60 = 2/3 & Odds for placebo = 10/90 = 1/9 . 4/99.6 & .1/99.9 are wrong .

Since we are already in the video it should be "In this module "!

if you take 100% and reduce it by 25% you now have 75%



g.What percent of participants in the placebo group have hypertension?\n\nGiven figures are 2409/3258 (73.9) which I suppose means that 2409 subjects out of 3258 evaluated (which calculates to 73.9%) had hypertension.\n\nHowever, the question asked about the placebo group (n=3281) and not about those evaluated for hypertension in the placebo group (n=3258). By easy observation, 2409 subjects had hypertension in the "placebo group". So doesn\'t it calculate out that (2409 / 3281 * 100 =) 73.4% had hypertension in the placebo group? Where did I go wrong? Please guide.





same problem!

Are there deadlines for the quizzes accompanying the modules? Or can we solve them whenever we want?



It is good to help other students but discussing how to get the exact answers to the quizzes or homework before the due date may be an honor code issue.

No help from the button "show answers"? (at the bottom of the homework page)

You can do them whenever as long as they are all done by the end of the class, August 16 1900 UTC.



The deadlines are clearly stated on the Courseware page and the syllabus.

Where can I download mock class data?I need them to work with R.\nThank you

Perhaps the Google programmers have just implemented the given dogma rather than thinking more about it ?

Question as phrased by you means as per available data on hypertension  answer is 60% & statement pertaining to missing values is not clear. However we can go by available data only & **large scale missing values do raise a question mark on validity of the study.**

This is already discussed [here][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine/discussion/forum/i4x-SampleUniversity-HRP258-course-Introduction_to_Medical_Statistics/threads/51bfdb0a22429c1200000045

in the homework if we calculate something to say, 1.9288 in question one, which gets rounded to x.x = 1.9, if the next question requires that number be used in further calculations, do we use 1.9 or do we use the more precise 1.9288 in the calculations? I am finding that it makes a difference in the future answers, for example one way something may come up as for example 17.6 vs 17.7 depending on which number was used (1.9 or 1.9288).  (btw these numbers are for example only.) also thanks very much for this free course!

Hi, I got the average total of quizzes 100% and the same for Hws. The final total shows as 55%. How can this be correct?

s more a question of right logic & approach & not right answer . However large scale posting of quiz answer in another context or with homeworks ; it

So you have done all the homework and all the quizzes? In which case, have you read the course syllabus regarding allocation of marks? There is a final "exam".

Thanks! I should be working with percentages.

Really the first time to understand the concept of odds ratio this clear.\nThank you very much.

The syllabus says the final exam is August 13-August 16. Is it possible to take the final as soon as we are done with the homework and lectures?

Q10 says "using the percentages given in the table".  You used the actual numbers and bypassed the percentages, which accounts for the difference.

since the number of tickets bought = 100, the money lost would be 100 dollars and not 1 dollar. so the expected value should be\n5.7 * 10^-7 * 500,000,000 + .99999943 * (-100) = +185.01\nAm I correct?

And this is why releasing all the material at the start is probably not a good idea.

I disagree.  Each one of us studies at his or her own pace. I would like to see the final exam be made available as soon as one has completed the homework and quizzes.

that\'s why a well written study and report will include the total number of people in the group and also the number who responded, so you could get the full story \n\nit would include a little section that actually look like the quiz \n\n    Baseline Patient Characteristics\n    \n    Characteristics\tRanolazine (n=3279)\tPlacebo (n=3281)\n    Hypertension\t2395/3257 (73.5)\t2409/3258 (73.9)\n\nthat\'s why newspapers and "generic" magazines are considered poor sources for information\n\na newspaper will have an article "Recent study shows 100% of people have hypertension."\n\nbut a professional, scientific journal will include the actual numbers

From unit 3, module 1, optional:\n\n"What\x92s the probability of rolling at least 1 six when you roll 4 dice?\nIt\x92s hard to calculate the probability of at least one (=1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4 sixes). It\x92s easier to calculate the probability of getting 0 sixes. \nP(no sixes) = (5/6)^4  = 48.2%\nP(at least one six) = 1-P(no sixes) = 51.8%"\n\nIf you used the logic you described above of adding the individual proababilities, then P(at least one six) in 4 rolls would be\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 67%\n\nBut, if you rolled 7 times, your logic would imply\n1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 7/6 = 117%.\n\nWe know it can\'t be possible for P > 100%, so this logic is flawed.\nThat is why we calculate P(no events) and then subtract that from 1 to get P(at least one event).\n\nIt is just coincidental that your addition of the 100 probabilities in the HIV example is less than 100%.  Since the P(once) is less than 1% (.2%), when you add it 100 times (or multiply it by 100), you get 20%.  If the example asked for the P(at least once) in more than 500 tries (makes me tired thinking about it!), this approach would yield more than 100%.\n\nHope this helps!

s the probability of at least one person misinterpreting the above semantics of the 5700 people in this course?\n\nIf we assume that each person's interpretation is both independent and not mutually exclusive from other people

Good suggestion!





I think it should be\n5.7 * 10^(-7) * (500000000-100) + .99999943*(-100) = 185

It is debateable, but the progress bar uses a denominator of total possible points from all homeworks/quizzes whether completed or not, rather than using a denominator of those completed.

I also disagree. I am trying to do most of the tests within this month as next month is exam time and I will be traipsing round the country to conduct exams etc so it indeed is not a bad idea to be able to finsih a;ll assignments at our pace.This is not a full ti,me course.One thing that would be really helpful is to have the actual exam spread over a weekend so that people at work can also get"useful" time to do the test. Useful time being total time - (work hours + sleep + time for bodily functions) ! That time will be substantially More when it is spread to touch Sunday round the world.

ROFL

You hit the time bomb !! Unfortunatley it seems they cannot reset (at least so far)

Some of the problems in later modules have multiple radio buttons.You may have clicked on a particular button but worse still you may have not clicked a button but clicked in the area right of the vertical line on the left side of the page.This selects a radio button nearest to it. I had answered  some questions and did  save some them individually but some in groups. While rechecking I was horrified to see that my choices had actually changed and luckily I did not hit the final check button and re-corrected them and submitted them. I would have got 6 answers wrong when actually I had got all answers correct !.This problem also occurred in another Edx course and they had to change the radiobutton method to another one (The square button kind).I really look forward to the individual Save and Submit buttons for the home-works. It is really difficult to scroll up and down to save and when you are doing your homework in a "timed" manner like in an exam this can be a really painful interruption to the flow of thought.Also  in serial questions where the answer of one progresses to be a part of the question for the next question this causes a complete collapse of the next questions despite knowing the methodology(usually due to  things like rounding etc if not due to a wrong method !!). I hope these problems are solved but I really think the radio button and individual save and submit buttons should be changed at the earliest.

I have managed to download the videos for the various units.I also have been able to download the .srt files for the respective videos(The caption files ). Now if I want captions for the videos on VLC media player, every time I load the video I have to click in the relevant caption file.Is there any way to bind these together so that I do not have to do it every time ? I would really appreciate advice regarding this.

Dear Mr Rajhansa, I have been sending the  .srt files to you so that they can be uploaded to the wiki (So far I have sent Unit 3,4,5 and 6). I am not sure if you are receiving them and I asked in an email  included with one batch of .srt files to kindly give me a reply so that I know they are reaching the receiver. I haven\'t got any reply so if Mr Rajhansa could confirm it I will be sure that I am emailing it to him rather than it being lost in some misty corner of cyberspace crying like a lost child for its recipient :) and the wiki cries -Where is my sister" ;)\nSorry but I think very "visually" even when I do my problems and that visualization of the wiki crying for its sister reminds me to email Rajhansa the .srt files when I finish downloading them..

Can any people tell me.  It is the first time I saw that slash in conditional probability.  Thanks

VLC finds subtitle files if their name is the same as the video file in the same folder (except for filename extension).  If this is not happening, check your VLC preferences.  In the advanced preferences, under Video/Subtitles I have an option for "autodetect subtitle files" that is on by default.\n\nOnce the video file is playing and the subtitles are detected, you can toggle/cycle the subtitles with the s key.



They show the answers/explanations here too, as soon as you submit

Thanks a zillion. I will try it.

I have also seen the pipe symbol | also used for this in some books.\nPrasanna

This is an incentive for not postponing R & Dedeucer part any further. These  are totally new things for me  but nevertheless one of the most important part of the course. I had downloaded Deducer but yet to open it!!

I see nothing when I go to the wiki.



Viola - it worked

One more question How do you get the subtitles to scroll on the top of a video or better still outside the frame ? They overlap at times with the material on the video so ideally if they can scroll outside the videopo fram in the black area it would be ideal,

I tried submitting using non-rounding. For one question (the one I think you are talking about), it agreed with the answer/explanation.  For a later question in the same homework, the answer given was different from mine due to rounding, but it still accepted my answer as correct.



I found a setting to "force subtitle position" in the advanced preferences, but it doesn\'t seem to work (it\'s supposed to move the subtitles up or down by the number of pixels you enter, I think).  I found an opacity setting in the non-advanced settings that does work, but not until the video is re-opened after changing the setting.  At least you can see through the subs when you want.  And again, you can quickly turn them on and off using the s key.

Sorry Voila

It would be great if you let us submit 2 times, it would allow us correct arithmetic errors, thanks.

I just experienced this issue on the HW - solved a problem, clicked on the desired radio button, then as I was scrolling up/down must have clicked somewhere to the right of the problem I had already solved which changed my answer.  I was not as diligent as I should have been and only realized it after submitting! Please, is there any way to make clicking on the radio button the only way to select it?

Me too, I think is a very good idea and better if Staff release the Final Exam to do when students finish his/her homeworks.

You have to click on "Week 2 (Solution)" to see the exercise.  Note that no solution is shown, so there is no danger of seeing the answer prematurely.  The link should really be named "Week 2 Extra Exercise."

I found this exension called subtitler but for the life of me cannot understand how to install it\nit is there at\nhttp://addons.videolan.org/\n\nhttp://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php/Subtitler+%28lite%29?content=152364\n\nIf you can deduce how to load it it would be helpful9It is supposed to get a subtitle bar and play it htere but the process seems so convoluted and I am afraid to wreck what is a good thing !!

Thank you.

My experience is that once you have clicked on the radio button, the focus remains there until you actually click somewhere else. So if you select then go directly to using the arrows on your keyboard or page up/down to scroll, the focus will move to the next radio button, and the next etc. (and you may not notice!!). You can get out of that by clicking on a scroll arrow as soon as you have selected your choice or radio button. I am not sure if it is an html thing or what. I found I had the same problem years ago when designing forms in Access. I had forgotten all about it until I took a Coursera course.\nKey thing is check, check and then check again!

How do you get the "adjusted" Odds ratio? Slide 95\nI understand how to get the odds ratio- but do not see how to make this next conversion.

Raj and Professor Sainani,\n\nPlease allow enough flexibility on the time window to take the final exam.\nSome of us can only work on it on weekday evenings, others only on weekends.\n\nFor example, I can only work ~1-1.5 hour a day on it after work on weekdays.\nI will **not** have time to work on it over the weekend.\n\nIn general, I think a 9-day window (2 weekends + 5 weekdays) will work best for a majority of people.

Well I just managed to do it and get a separate subwindow that shows the subtitles in a large font.Only problem is it continuously re-sizes but that seems manageable.

Sorry if that was unclear. I changed the link to "Week 2 Extra Exercise." Click on that link (not Solution) and it should pull up the questions.\n\nI will post a solution sometime over the weekend.

Good job! Where did you get subtitles from?

Are there any studies on how often the news mis-reports the findings of studies, as in the case of the soda story?  Also, are there any studies on how often the studies themselves mislead readers, as in the Vioxx study?  I would really like to hear about other studies misreported by the news and also to get a sense of how often it occurs.

I am not up to that module yet so I am not familiar with the numbers but I think you are making a mistake on P(x = 1). If I understand your question, this is a binomial probability.  If the probability of testing positive is 1/500, the probability of not testing positive is 499/500.  The probability of exactly one success (HIV positive) in n trials (n subjects) is 100 * (1/500)^1 * (499/500)^(n-1).  One case positive, 99 cases negative.  The probability of exactly 2 successes would be nC2*(1/500)^2*(499/500)^(n-2).  The nCx (100 and nC2) are the number of ways you can have exactly x successes in n trials.  Now if you calculate all those probabilities they will add up to 18%.\n\nThat is why you want P(x ? 1) = 1 - P(x = 0).  P(x = 0) = (499/500)^n.\n\nI hope I did understood your question and did not confuse you further.

The use is perfectly okay. There is no standard version of English across countries. US English is different to British English is different to Indian English is different to whatever English.

Hello,\nCould you please include the download link for the second part.

Hello, could you please include the download link for the second part. Thank you!

I have thought about this. I would show how the nomenclature goes like this: the original ratio is Events per Person-Year (E/P-Y). Without regard to multiplying by 100 or 1000 (just to eliminate the decimal), the units remain the same. Then, finding the NNT is simply the reciprocal of that original ratio. So, E/P-Y becomes Person-Year per Event (P-Y/E). In the case given 2.4 events/person-year, when "flipped" becomes .42. Then, manipulating the decimal by a factor of 100 yields 42 person-years per(one)event (P-Y/E).\n\nTherefore, the Event becomes the denominator when seeking the NNT.\n\nAlso, take care to notice the "dash" between Person and Year, i.e., Person-Year. This "dash" implies Multiplication of the two dimensions. Similar to the physics measurement of torque is Foot-Pounds, or Newton-Kilograms. The "dash" represents products of two dissimilar dimensions.

I can\'t seem to find the data for the survival or the rats. In the library my console replies "install.packages(c("survival"),"C:/Users/owner/Documents/R/win-library/2.15")\nWarning: package \'survival\' is in use and will not be installed.\n\nSo, is this right? Where would the data reside?

The link from the first part of the module should include both part 1 and 2.

s got two parts--one quantitative (time) and one binary (had the event or didn't), so it's usually analyzed with different statistical tests. If you treat it as quantitative (time part), this would ignore the important fact of who had the event and who didn

Most of the calculations for this class can be done by hand.

We will also be posting video answers in which the TA walks through the answers for you. Look for this shortly!

We have built in tolerances in the answers that should allow for slight differences in rounding in progressive questions.

Wow, great job getting a 100% on everything and so quickly!  The quizzes and homeworks count as 55% of the grade, so the last 45 points will come from the final exam (which will be offered in August).

I will alert our tech team and have them look into this.



I did discuss this in a medical writers forum (and Yes the ones who responded where American and they did not agree with you for what its worth.!)

I used a software called Google2SRT-0.5.6 which is a freeware.It is a laborious process and the software has a tendency to overwrite the .srt files if not careful and you may lose what you did !! So you have to be careful !! (it is a repetitive boring job so do it  when you are not that busy.)\nhttp://google2srt.sourceforge.net/en/download.html

That explains it, thanks!

ohhh ! I see . Thanks!

Prasa, an appropriate, constructive response would include WHY they think I/we are wrong.  If that is not included, their objections are worthless.

Well, I can play that game too: those "experts" and your American friends are wrong :)\n\nSee how that doesn\'t work?\n\nAnyhow, let me finish this off: "in this next module" makes explicit the fact that the module occurs in a sequence of modules.  Furthermore, it says that at least one module came before it and that at least one module will come after it.  "In this module" does NONE of that.  \n\nYou\'re welcome :)

Just wondering whether the exam will be timed or whether it will be similar to homework so we can take as much time as we like (within the time window that the exam is available for)?\nThanks :)

For the reasons already mentioned. That is why I did not mention it again mixing of present and future and being iterative.

Next does not mean future, it means to follow something else.

i have problems with my grades because i did all my quizes corectly but some of them show me a grade of 50 % where all my answer are right!! can you help me please?

If you\'re not going to respond to my reasoning then a. I give up and b. give me the link to this discussion so I can take it up with someone who will.  "In this module" and "in this next module" say slightly different things and as such, it is personal preference which one you use.

...and I choose, along with the Stanford professor who teaches writing in the sciences, "in this next module" as it communicates slightly more information.

The data variable that I am seeing in the R are intergers while the unit 1 R exercise say change the varsity data type from double to factor. It is not double why is it double in the video and not in my R. I tried uploading the XLS file multiple times but its the same

Thank you, Rhetorica!



Dear Notis, Thank you very much for your comment..\n\nIn continuation to your explanation if the orthopedist also involved with me in the same study then it will become an international study right??

Please see the posts - I gave the reasoning which you choose not to see. Future references to the time line. You can choose to do whatever but this is what the grammar experts and technical writers also told me. I discussed this with them on emails.

We know that the arithmetic is slightly off, and we plan to fix it soon. Thanks for pointing it out!\n\nRaj

The cumulative risk for Vioxx is 0.42%, and for Naproxen it is 0.1%. So we can say that Vioxx is 4.2 times as risky than Naproxen, or, equivalently, that it is 3.2 times riskier than Naproxen.\n\nThink about it this way: If the risks were 0.15% and 0.1% respectively, you would say that Vioxx is 1.5 times as risky, or 50% riskier. Notice that you get the second number (50% or 0.5) by subtracting 1 from the ratio (1.5). Similarly, in our case, we can say that Vioxx is (4.2-1=) 3.2 or 320% riskier.\n\nRaj

The question states:\n\n1. If 40% of a treated group has a positive response versus just 10% of the placebo group, what are the risk ratio and odds ratio (for treatment vs. placebo)?\n\nRisk ratio has been defined as "ratio of cumulative risks OR ratio of prevalences" in the lecture video.\n\nFor calculating risk ratio we need to find the cumulative risk or prevalence.\n\nNow cumulative risk has been defined as "proportion of people who developed disease over time" in the respective video lecture.\n\nI have calculated and got my answer right, but I\'m posting as my concept remains unclear.\n\nSo in this question, 40% people in the treated group got a favorable response. According to the calculations, these 40% people had the risk of being cured? (Yeah I know it sounds so funny). I failed to understand that how can a treatment be regarded as a "risk"? Rather those subjects who didn\'t get a positive response were at a risk of remaining untreated because they still were suffering from the disease.\n\nKindly help.

@robert_dickson, Yes, the package `survival` is included in most installations of R, as it apparently is in yours. It is also apparently already in use, so if you just type `data(rats)` at the R console, it should load a data frame called `rats` with the appropriate variables. \n\nR comes pre-loaded with many practice datasets, which you can see by typing `data()` in the console.

However, this may cause delays for students racing to meet a deadline, resulting in zero credit.  So it would be best to use the time of the first button click rather than the time the Confirm option is clicked.

I finished a quiz early. The questions require some evaluations to some statistical studies. Some of my answers are marked as wrong. But I think I have "valid" reasons for picking certain "wrong" answers, and the explanations given can\'t quite convince me to pick the "right" ones... Since it\'s inappropriate to discuss them until the quiz is due... Is there any way to voice my concerns about the questions set as they are now?

i am finding it confusing about the calculation of the corresponding odd ratios between the first calculation and the second calculation in module 5; unit 2. is there asimple way or a generalized way of calculating it?

I have one doubt regarding the slide named as RR have cielings!\nHow we got the data you mentioned in the slide like if we have an outcome with prevalence 10% we cannot have a RR of more than 10?\n\nMany thanks for such a insightful course material!!!

Classically Risk ratio is ratio of a measure of disease frequency in study group & control group . While terminology continues, modern day epidemiology & biostatistics concerns distribution of not just disease but its determinants and in general all health related conditions including treatment modalities , preventive measures & diagnostics . **As per Wikipedia: Epidemiology is defined as the study of distribution and determinants of health related states in populations and use of this study to address health related problems .** One may google definition of Epidemiology on net for more precise & in depth discussion on this if interested . You may start [here][1].\n\n\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology

Generally, such confirmations are performed on the browser without requiring a round trip to the server.  Consequently, if a student is moving quickly, the difference could be on the order of a second regardless of the network speed.\n\nI work on a course system at a major university, and I have never heard a complaint about having a confirmation step and plenty of complaints where one is left out for some operation.



I will forward this to tech support to see if they can diagnose.



The idea is that you cannot have more than 10x10%, because this would mean that the prevalence/risk was over 100%!

Thanks for your concern & quick response . I am sure yours & like efforts will be fruitful soon.

what is meant by multiple pregnancy? it is as defined in question no, 1 or anything else please clarify it to me\nthanks

Doing a nested-controlled study supposes you collected and stored something (a biological parameter that may be possibly analysed later on) at the beginning of the study. It should be done when the patients enter the study. That is not the case in a cross-sectional study.

Question 8: answer was suppose to be in hundredth and I rounded up each step in my calculation to hundredth and I got the answer wrong\nQuestion 10 and 11: in the tutorial Pref was used as risk/prevalence and not calculate it as odds but in the answer Pref was calculated as odd. Which is correct way of calculating Pref (risk/prevalence outcome reference)

Next does not mean future, it means subsequent.  Look it up please.  Soooo, "in this NEXT module" means..."in this module, WHICH COMES AFTER ANOTHER MODULE,..."

I am working on Question 10 for Homework 4 which has a "hint" to use the normal approximation to the binomial.  Using the exact binomial versus the normal approximation gives answers different enough that one or the other is likely to be graded as incorrect.  Is the "hint" actually more than just a hint?  That is, should I read that question as *requiring* the normal approximation?

NNT is inverse risk difference and usually some number with a decimal of form say pq.xy . If decimal part 0.xy >= 0.5 then NNT is a whole number pq + 1 . What if decimal part 0.xy < 0.5 ? Logically here too we need to treat pq + 1 persons in order to treat a single person . But if we calculate NNT by following usual rounding off convention/practice in mathematics the answer would be not pq + 1 but only pq . Which of the two is correct?

I do agree with robert_dickinson\'s reply. However that still makes me uneasy about the satement:\nYou prevent 2.4 GI events when you treat 100 people with Vioxx. So you need to treat 100/2.4 = 42 people to prevent 1 GI event.\nFrom slide 45. We actually know that you prevent 2.4 GI events when you treat 100 people-YEARS with Vioxx. What happened to the "year" in this statement? If anything it should say you prevent 2.4 GI events when you treat 100 people for 1 year? It gets really awkward when you deliberately misuse the number - you could say I prevent 240 GI events when I treat 100 people for 100 years which is obviously nonsense. I don\'t quite see the information content of NNT unless there is an accepted time frame in which the GI actually occurs if it ever does so. Thoughts appreciated.

What bugged me for some time was the term "adjusted risk". It\'s not clear what this meant from the question, nor was there anything about this in the lectures. For the purposes of Q5-8, this ignore "adjusted", and treat it as the cumulative risk. For anyone interested, the "adjusted" part comes from the fact that they determined the risk value from odds ratios that were estimated from logistic regressions.

s probably no population data that



Pref is the probability (% or decimal) for the reference variable and is always less than one.  It is used to help determine the odds ratio (OR).  OR can be <1, 1, or >1, and it has no units since it is probabilities/probabilities.

You can quantify the "skewness" using a test. Even better is to use a test (eg Shapiro\x96Wilk) to evaluate the normality of a sample. From these tests, you should then decide whether to report the mean or median.\n\nIt\'s a misnomer to say that readers are more comfortable with the mean. Consider the fact that many clinical articles a even the press have been using median for a long time (eg. "average" salaries in a country are reported as median and not mean).

s not the educator or even my effort on the studies, it's the inconsistencies in language and vagueness of the questions.\n\nFrankly, the last table of homework 2 is INCREDIBLY confusing to understand. (for instance, isn't <10 the same as >5 .... I just couldn

Pleas anybody can suggest me how to submit the weekly quiz.\nthanks

Fill in your answers. Click Check (if a quiz). Click Final Check if homework.

It would be nice to allow at-least 2 attempts.

It is **not for us (students) and the crediting body to work it out**.It is for the Stanford Edx team and the crediting body to get sanctioned CME credit status as individuals cannot claim credits but the educating body needs to apply for the **ability to award credits** for a particular activity !!

I di it both with the actual binomial calculator and the normal calculator and did get different results.Use the normal approximation as suggested.

It seems there is no repsone to this even on the list.I see that Mr Rajhansa has replied to other posts .Could you please give me a reply confirming that you have received the .srt files ?

Next is something that has not happened but going to happen .Something that is "subsequent" is not in the present We are already in the video.This video is not a bridge introductory video and the module title has already come up.

Hello Raj and Otar I think Otar is right here

I was initially thrown by the use of "risk" in the figure as opposed to (actual) hospitalisation in the questions. I initially thought I would have to convert the risk into actual incidences but that didn\'t seem to the case when it came to doing the calculations

Look at the discussion regarding the posting "Unit 2 Homework question 11"

Thank you for this question. Aim of the study is to assess effect of cardiac rehabilitation  depending on the presence or absence arterial hypertension.

Ali, there is some explanation in the introductory notes for week 2. YOu should be getting ticks when you submit answers for a quiz or homework.

Also, that would be a good use for the wiki.  Multiple people could contribute for all to use.

The question formulation should be altered since they ask in percents but the choices are in proportions.  Also, they should specify to how many decimal places the answer should be reported.  The choices listed are from 4 to 6 digits, and two of the answers are the same depending on if you round at 4 decimal places.

I know the question asked for the Placebo percentage for >=5 Kg. However, what got me confused was that there are 4 different Pref (29%, 59%, 87% and 91%) that you could use. How were you able to determine 29% as Pref? Thanks

But in the example of GI events in module 2/unit 2, she obtained 2315 person-years for Vioxx group, but if you divide 4047 people to 0.57 (6.8 months of follow up as an average) you obtain 2307 person years....how did you get 2315?

Thanks Rajhansa, I kinda guessed that. sallysue, I believe the lectures referred to adjusted risk ratio and not adjusted risk, which made me double think whether I had to calculate the unadjusted risk like dvanreyk points out below.

I heard the lectures but want to know about quizzes



Is NNH a more appropriated term to use when describing the GI events associated with Vioxx?  NNT is more often referring to positive treatment outcomes.

Gives a lot of insight.

Also on Naproxen, 121 / 2316 is .052 not .045.\nBeware that those wrong figures are repeated in the slide "Difference in rates, GI events".

Autors have calculated adjusted OR using logistic regression, see in the blank "95% CI"

Hello, I got a question wrong (number 4, week 2) but I think it is only because I used the original data instead of rounded data, so I think that my answer is actually more correct than the official correct answer.  How do I request a recheck on my answer?

Hi,\nI assume I am making some silly error here but for incidence rate calculations\n\n56/2315=0.02419?? But video says 0.021? and 121/2316= 0.052245?? What am I missing?\nThanks,

First, you could not do randomization with smoking.  It would be unethical to create a smoking group.  So smoking will never be randomized.  However if we could do a randomized study of smoking, randomly assigning people to smoking condition would ideally balance alcohol consumption in the different smoking conditions.

I went with 5.3 when i submitted my answer (assuming that you would have that much margin since 5.3 both the answers are correct) but my ans was marked as incorrect.\n\nif you calcualte the answers in 2 different ways (but same values)- you get 2 different answers but both are correct.

"Number Needed to Harm" involves a calculation comparing two groups: one group where a factor is present, versus another group where the factor is not present.\n\nIn this question, we are given two groups taking different medications; are we to assume that we are are comparing the group "taking Vioxx" versus the group "not taking Vioxx", and to calculate a "number needed to harm" for the "presence of Vioxx"?

Is it just me or the sound volume in the videos is very low?  Even with the volume at maximum levels, I can barely hear unless it is completely silent around me?



I was wondering how you determine which group risk or odds goes in the denominator when doing ratios?  Based on lecture it seems that you usually pick your reference/control group as the denominator.  In these questions it asked for "single-pill" versus "three pill" groups.  How do you decide which is the denominator to get a correct answer on the homework question.  I understand the interpretations, but I guess the denominator can always be reversed based on how you interpret it (similar to what happened in the vioxx study).

Randomization is assigning subjects to the different levels of a variable. The experimenter controls assignment by randomly assigning subjects to the different levels.  Without random assignment, you are correct that alcohol consumption is confounded with smoking. What you are describing is an observational study.  You simply take subjects as you find them, hence observational.

Hi Brandy, I\'ve got exactly the same question! I thought you would divide by the control group to get risk - as this is your benchmark. In t[he optional reading][1], this is how it is explained: "The risk ratio divides the risk (or prevalence) in an exposed group by the risk in a\nreference group"\n\nThe paper goes on to say that you can also flip the denominators. Perhaps the question could have been phrased more clearly, indicating which is the reference group? Or is it simply the first mentioned group goes on top and the second one is the denominator?\n\n\n  [1]: http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1934-1482/PIIS1934148211000530.pdf

May be that questions n\xba 7 and n\xba 8 of this homework are the same?

Oh and here\'s another (!) piece of evidence: where is your notion of future in "next person in line" or "next room"?  Oh, wait, you don\'t want any evidence, your mind is made up!  Sigh



In the question n\xba 10, should I use correction for continuity? with the normal aproximation p(x>= 112)should be planteated as p(x>= 111,5)? because in a case the % is 4.48 and with the c.c. is 5.19 %.



Your lowest homework score will be dropped, so not to worry. The passing grade for the course is also 60%, so we hope this should be doable even with some silly mistakes.

This may become a CME-approved course in the future. We will post details on this when we have them.

The key is that if you ignore order in the numerator, you must also ignore it in the denominator. The alternative is to consider order in both the numerator and the denominator. So the probability winds up the same either way!
